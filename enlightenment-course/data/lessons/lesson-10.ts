        title: "The Professor's Great Book",
        content: `My name is James, and I am fourteen years old. I serve as an apprentice to a merchant in Glasgow, Scotland, learning the trade that I hope will one day make my fortune. And this year of 1776, while the American colonies are declaring their independence across the Atlantic, something equally revolutionary is happening right here in Britain.

A professor named Adam Smith has published a massive book called *An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*. My master, Mr. Campbell, has been reading it aloud in the evenings, and he says it will change how the world thinks about commerce, trade, and prosperity.

"This book," Mr. Campbell declared, tapping the thick volume, "explains what we merchants have always sensed but could never quite put into words. It shows how the pursuit of self-interest, properly channeled, can benefit everyone."

I knew something of Adam Smith already. He had been a professor at the University of Glasgow before spending years as a tutor to a young duke, traveling across Europe and meeting the great philosophers of France. Now, after more than a decade of work, he had produced this monument of Enlightenment thinking applied to economics.

But what did it mean for a boy like me, hoping to make his way in the world of trade?`

        title: "The Invisible Hand",
        content: `The most famous idea in Smith's book is what he called the "invisible hand." It sounds almost mystical, but the concept is really quite practical.

Imagine a baker, Smith suggests. The baker does not wake up each morning thinking, "How can I serve my community today?" No—the baker thinks about earning a living, providing for his family, making a profit. Yet in pursuing this self-interest, the baker produces bread that feeds his neighbors.

The same is true for the butcher, the brewer, the candlemaker. "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner," Smith wrote, "but from their regard to their own interest."

Here is the remarkable insight: when many people pursue their own interests in a free market, an "invisible hand" guides their efforts toward outcomes that benefit society as a whole. No king or central planner needs to direct the economy. The price system, responding to supply and demand, coordinates millions of individual decisions far better than any human authority could.

Mr. Campbell explained this to me with our own trade. "When cloth is scarce, the price rises. That signals weavers to produce more. When it is abundant, the price falls, and weavers turn to other goods. No one commands this—it happens naturally, guided by prices that tell us what society needs."

This was revolutionary. For centuries, rulers had tried to manage economies through regulations, monopolies, and decrees. Smith argued that freedom produced better results.`

      {
        title: "The Division of Labor",
        content: `Smith opened his book with another powerful insight: the division of labor. He used the example of a pin factory.

One worker making pins alone, doing every step himself, might produce a handful of pins in a day. But divide the work—one person draws the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds the top for the head—and the same number of workers can produce thousands of pins.

"The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour," Smith wrote, "seem to have been the effects of the division of labour."

I saw this in Mr. Campbell's warehouse. Each clerk had specialized tasks. One kept the accounts, another managed correspondence with suppliers, a third organized the warehouse inventory. Together, we accomplished far more than if each person tried to do everything.

Smith connected this to the size of markets. Division of labor is limited, he explained, by the extent of the market. A village can support only a general blacksmith. A city can support specialists—one who makes only horseshoes, another only nails, another only locks. Trade expands markets, enabling greater specialization, which increases productivity, which creates more wealth.

This is why Smith opposed trade barriers and monopolies. They shrank markets and prevented the division of labor from reaching its full potential. Free trade between nations, like free exchange within nations, made everyone richer.`

      {
        title: "Against Mercantilism",
        content: `Smith wrote his book partly to attack the economic system that dominated his era: mercantilism. Mercantilist thinking held that wealth was a fixed quantity of gold and silver, and that nations grew rich by hoarding precious metals and running trade surpluses.

Governments enacted endless regulations to achieve these goals. They granted monopolies to favored companies. They banned the export of gold and the import of manufactured goods. They required colonies to trade only with the mother country.

Smith argued that this was all wrong. Wealth was not gold sitting in a vault—wealth was the goods and services that improved people's lives. A nation grew wealthy not by hoarding metal but by producing more of what people wanted.

"Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production," Smith wrote. The goal of economic activity is to satisfy human wants. Policies that enriched a few merchants while impoverishing consumers were foolish.

This had direct implications for Britain's American colonies. Mercantilist policies restricted colonial trade, forcing Americans to buy from British merchants at high prices and sell their products only to Britain at low prices. Smith sympathized with colonial grievances. He even suggested that the colonies might be better off independent—advice that was, at that very moment, being tested across the Atlantic.`
      },
      {
        title: "Liberty and Prosperity",
        content: `What struck me most about Smith's work was how it connected economics to the broader ideas of the Enlightenment. Just as Locke had argued for natural rights and Montesquieu for limited government, Smith argued for economic liberty.

"Every man, as long as he does not violate the laws of justice," Smith wrote, "is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest his own way, and to bring both his industry and capital into competition with those of any other man."

This was a vision of freedom—not just political freedom, but the freedom to work, trade, and prosper without arbitrary interference from government. The same Enlightenment principles that demanded representative government and natural rights also demanded free markets.

Smith did not argue for no government at all. He believed the state should provide defense, justice, and certain public works that private enterprise would not undertake—roads, canals, education. But beyond these essential functions, government should step back and let the invisible hand work.

As I grew into my career as a merchant, I came to see Smith's vision playing out before my eyes. Britain's economy grew as trade expanded. The industrial revolution, just beginning, would transform the world. And the new American nation, founded on Enlightenment principles, would embrace economic liberty alongside political liberty.

Adam Smith never lived to see the full flowering of his ideas. He died in 1790, as the world he helped shape was just beginning to emerge. But his *Wealth of Nations* remains one of the most influential books ever written—the foundation of modern economics and a cornerstone of Enlightenment thought applied to the practical business of making a living.`
