        title: "The General Returns",
        content: `My name is Tobias, and I am fifteen years old. I work in the household at Mount Vernon, the Virginia estate of George Washington—the man they call the Father of His Country.

General Washington is old now, sixty-seven years, and he has finally come home to stay. For most of my life, he has been away—commanding armies, presiding over conventions, serving as President. But now he walks the grounds of his plantation, tends to his farms, and receives the endless stream of visitors who come to see the most famous man in America.

Everyone says there would be no United States without George Washington. Not because of his brilliance—others were more learned, more eloquent, more creative. But because of his character. At every moment when the new nation might have failed, Washington held it together through the sheer force of his integrity.

I have watched him carefully these past months. He is not the warm, witty presence of Dr. Franklin or the passionate intensity of Mr. Jefferson. He is reserved, dignified, almost formal. Yet there is something about him that makes other men want to follow, to sacrifice, to believe.

What is it about this man that made a revolution succeed and a republic endure?`

        title: "The Power He Would Not Seize",
        content: `The stories are legendary now, but I have heard them directly from men who were there.

In March 1783, the Revolutionary War was ending, but the Continental Congress had not paid the army in years. Officers gathered at Newburgh, New York, plotting to march on Congress and demand their money at gunpoint—or perhaps to make Washington a king and dispense with the feeble government altogether.

Washington arrived at their meeting unannounced. He spoke against mutiny, appealing to their honor and their sacrifices. The officers were unmoved. Then Washington pulled out a letter from Congress and fumbled with his spectacles.

"Gentlemen," he said, "you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country."

The officers wept. The conspiracy dissolved. Washington had shown them their own better selves.

Then, at war's end, Washington did what no victorious general had ever done: he resigned his commission and went home. King George III, when told that Washington would give up power and return to his farm, reportedly said, "If he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world."

Washington understood what few powerful men ever grasp: that laying down power can be more important than wielding it. A republic requires leaders who serve and then depart, making room for others. Washington modeled this from the beginning.`

        title: "The Constitutional President",
        content: `When Washington agreed to preside over the Constitutional Convention in 1787, he lent his prestige to the enterprise. Without him, many delegates might not have come. Without him, the public might not have trusted the result.

He said little during the debates but managed them with quiet authority. His mere presence—the knowledge that Washington would likely be the first President—shaped how the delegates designed the executive branch. They gave the President significant powers because they trusted Washington not to abuse them.

As President, Washington was keenly aware that everything he did set a precedent. "I walk on untrodden ground," he wrote. "There is scarcely any part of my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent."

He established the cabinet—heads of departments who advised the President. He established the two-term tradition—serving eight years, then voluntarily retiring when he could easily have been elected again. He established the dignified but accessible style of the American presidency—neither a monarch nor a common politician.

When political parties formed and his own advisors—Hamilton and Jefferson—became bitter rivals, Washington struggled to remain above faction. He failed in the end; the partisan newspapers attacked him savagely. But his effort to place country above party set a standard that American leaders would forever be judged against.`
      },
      {
        title: "The Farewell",
        content: `In 1796, Washington announced he would not seek a third term. He published his Farewell Address—not a speech but a letter to the American people, drafted with Hamilton's help.

The Address warned against the dangers that could destroy the republic. Chief among them: the "baneful effects of the spirit of party." Washington had watched Hamilton and Jefferson tear at each other, had seen how partisan loyalty could override love of country. He urged Americans to remember that they were one nation, not a collection of factions.

He warned against "passionate attachment" to foreign nations and "inveterate hatred" toward others. America should trade with all but entangle itself in none. Foreign alliances could drag the young nation into wars that served others' interests, not its own.

He emphasized the importance of religion and morality as supports of political prosperity. Not that government should impose religion, but that a republic depends on virtuous citizens. "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity," he wrote, "religion and morality are indispensable supports."

The Farewell Address became scripture for American politics—quoted by every generation, invoked whenever the nation faced decisions about parties, foreign policy, or public virtue.`
      },
      {
        title: "The Legacy of Character",
        content: `George Washington died on December 14, 1799. The nation mourned as it had never mourned before. "First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen," said his friend Henry Lee.

But what exactly was Washington's contribution to the Enlightenment's American experiment?

He was not a philosopher. He left no treatises on natural rights or separation of powers. He was not an intellectual like Franklin, Jefferson, Madison, or Hamilton.

What Washington provided was character—and character, the Founders believed, was essential to republican government. A republic depends on leaders who will exercise power with restraint, who will serve the common good rather than their own ambition, who will set aside personal interest for public duty.

Washington embodied these virtues imperfectly—he held enslaved people, he sometimes let vanity influence his judgment, he made military and political mistakes. But he understood that in a government without kings, the character of leaders matters even more. Without an aristocracy of birth, America would need an aristocracy of virtue.

The Constitution provided the structure. The Bill of Rights protected the liberties. But it was Washington who showed that the system could work—that power could be exercised and then surrendered, that ambition could be checked by honor, that a republic could survive the transition from one leader to another.

Every peaceful transfer of power in American history traces back to Washington's example. Every leader who serves and then steps aside follows in his footsteps. The Enlightenment gave America its principles; Washington gave it the precedent of principled leadership.`
