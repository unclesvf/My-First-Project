        title: "A Book That Would Change History",
        content: `My name is Thomas, and I am fifteen years old. I work as an apprentice in a print shop near Fleet Street in London, and this year—1689—I have helped print a book that I believe will echo through the ages.

The book is called *Two Treatises of Government*, and its author is a man named John Locke. He is already famous among educated people for his writings on philosophy and the human mind, but this new work is different. This book is political dynamite.

Master Awnsham Churchill, my employer, made me swear secrecy about this project. Though the Glorious Revolution has just placed William and Mary on the throne, and the political winds have shifted, writing against the divine right of kings is still dangerous business. Mr. Locke himself only recently returned from exile in Holland, where he fled to escape the previous king's persecution.

"Read carefully, Thomas," Master Churchill told me as I set the type. "You are holding in your hands ideas that will shape how people think about government for centuries to come."

I did read carefully, every word, as I placed each letter into the composing stick. And what I found astonished me.`

        title: "The State of Nature",
        content: `Mr. Locke begins his argument with an extraordinary thought experiment. Imagine, he says, a time before governments existed—what he calls the "state of nature." In this original condition, all people were equal and free, bound only by the "law of nature" which is reason itself.

In the state of nature, according to Mr. Locke, every person has certain rights simply by being human. These are not granted by any king or government. They come from God and from the nature of humanity itself. Mr. Locke identifies these as the rights to life, liberty, and property.

Life—the right to preserve your own existence and not have it taken from you unjustly.

Liberty—the freedom to act according to your own will, within the bounds of natural law, without being subject to the arbitrary will of another person.

Property—the right to own things, which Mr. Locke argues comes from mixing your labor with the resources of nature. When you work the land, when you build something with your hands, you make it yours.

These ideas struck me like a thunderbolt. All my life, I had been taught that common people like me existed to serve our betters, that nobles and kings had a natural right to rule over us. But here was Mr. Locke saying that in our original nature, all people are equal!`
      },
      {
        title: "Why Governments Exist",
        content: `If people were free and equal in the state of nature, I wondered as I read on, why would they ever give that up? Why would they submit to governments at all?

Mr. Locke's answer was brilliantly simple. In the state of nature, there is no common judge to settle disputes, no established law, no power to enforce agreements. If someone steals from you or threatens your life, you must be your own judge and enforcer. This leads to chaos and insecurity.

So people agree to join together into societies and establish governments. But—and this is the crucial point—they do so by consent, through a "social contract." The government's authority comes entirely from the agreement of the people it governs.

This means the government exists to serve the people, not the other way around. Its purpose is to protect those natural rights—life, liberty, and property—that people already possessed in the state of nature. The government is a servant, not a master.

I paused in my typesetting to consider what this meant. If Mr. Locke was right, then kings do not rule by divine appointment. Their authority comes from the same place as any government's authority: the consent of the governed. A king who rules without that consent is not a legitimate ruler at all.`
      },
      {
        title: "The Right of Revolution",
        content: `The most explosive part of Mr. Locke's treatise—the part that made me understand why he had written it in exile—concerns what happens when governments fail.

If the purpose of government is to protect natural rights, Mr. Locke argues, then a government that violates those rights has broken the social contract. It has become illegitimate. And when a government becomes tyrannical—when it systematically abuses the rights of the people—the people have not just the right but the duty to resist and replace it.

"The people shall be judge," Mr. Locke writes. If a ruler places himself above the law, if he treats the people as his property rather than as the source of his authority, then he has declared war on his own subjects. In such a case, the people may rightfully overthrow him.

Master Churchill nodded gravely when I discussed this passage with him. "Mr. Locke wrote this to justify what we have just done," he said. "King James II claimed absolute authority. He tried to rule without Parliament, to impose his religion on the nation by force. We—the English people—judged him a tyrant and replaced him with William and Mary, who have agreed to govern with limits on their power."

The Glorious Revolution of 1688, I realized, was Locke's theory put into practice.`
      },
      {
        title: "Seeds for a New World",
        content: `As I completed the printing of Mr. Locke's treatises, I could not stop thinking about where these ideas might lead. If all people are born with equal natural rights, what does that say about the common folk like me? About the growing colonies in America? About people in other nations living under absolute monarchs?

Master Churchill shared something with me one evening. "Mr. Locke has friends in the American colonies," he said. "There is a group in Carolina that has been studying his ideas about government. And in Massachusetts and Virginia, educated men are reading everything he writes."

I imagined those colonists, three thousand miles across the ocean, reading the very words I had helped to print. People who had left England seeking freedom, who were building new societies in a new world. How might Locke's ideas about natural rights, consent of the governed, and the right to resist tyranny take root in that distant soil?

I could not know then that nearly a hundred years later, in 1776, American colonists would echo Mr. Locke's words almost exactly: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

Thomas Jefferson, the man who would write those words, would call John Locke one of the three greatest men who ever lived. The ideas I helped print in 1689 would become the philosophical foundation of a revolution that created the United States of America.

But all of that was still in the future. That night, I was simply an apprentice printer, handling pages that would change the world, beginning to understand that ideas about human rights and legitimate government could be more powerful than any army.`
