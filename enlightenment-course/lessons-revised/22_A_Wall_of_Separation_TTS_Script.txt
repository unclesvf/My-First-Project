Welcome to today's history lesson. A Wall of Separation. The Enlightenment Origins of Religious Freedom in America.

You will hear this story from Sarah, a fourteen year old daughter of a Baptist minister in Virginia, seventeen eighty-six.

Chapter One. Father's Imprisonment.

My name is Sarah, and I am fourteen years old. My father is a Baptist minister in Virginia, and when I was a small child, I watched him taken away to prison.

His crime? Preaching without a license from the Anglican Church.

In Virginia, the Anglican Church is established by law. Everyone must pay taxes to support it, whether they are Anglican or not. Ministers of other faiths need permission from Anglican authorities to preach. Those who preach without permission can be imprisoned.

Father spent nearly two years in jail. He continued to preach through the bars, and crowds gathered to hear him. The authorities were embarrassed but would not yield. The law was the law.

But something is changing in Virginia. The Revolution has stirred new ideas about liberty — not just political liberty, but liberty of conscience. If we fought a war so that government could not tell us what taxes to pay without our consent, how can government tell us what church to support or what God to worship?

Mr. Thomas Jefferson and Mr. James Madison have taken up our cause. This year of 1786, after years of struggle, they have won: the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom has become law. For the first time, a government has declared that religious belief is no business of the state.

Chapter Two. The Enlightenment and Religious Tolerance.

The Enlightenment philosophers had long argued for religious tolerance. Voltaire, after witnessing the horrors of religious persecution in France, made tolerance his lifelong cause. John Locke, in his Letter Concerning Toleration, argued that the civil magistrate has no authority over the soul.

But tolerance was not the same as freedom. A tolerant government might still favor one religion while permitting others. It might still require religious tests for office. It might still use tax money to support an established church.

Jefferson and Madison went further. They argued not just for tolerance but for complete separation of church and state. The government should have no power over religion whatsoever. No establishment, no funding, no interference of any kind.

"The legitimate powers of government," Jefferson wrote in his Notes on the State of Virginia, "extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg."

This was radical. In most of Europe, church and state were intertwined. Kings ruled by divine right. Established churches blessed governments and governments enforced religious conformity. The idea that government could simply stay out of religion seemed impossible — even dangerous.

Chapter Three. The Virginia Statute.

Jefferson drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1777, but it took nine years of struggle before the legislature finally passed it. Madison led the fight, writing his famous Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments to defeat a proposal for a general tax to support all Christian churches.

Madison's argument was brilliant. He pointed out that if government could support Christianity generally, it could also favor one Christian denomination over others. If it could require three pence for religion, it could require any amount. The power to support religion was also the power to control it.

"The Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man," Madison wrote. "It is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate."

When the Statute finally passed in 1786, it declared that no one would be "compelled to frequent or support any religious institution whatever." It declared that all citizens would be "free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion." And it declared that these rights were "the natural rights of mankind."

Jefferson was in Paris when he received the news. He had the Statute translated into French and Italian and distributed across Europe. He wanted the world to know what Virginia had done.

Chapter Four. The First Amendment.

The principles of the Virginia Statute are becoming the foundation of the First Amendment to the federal Constitution.

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

These sixteen words contain two protections. The Establishment Clause prevents government from creating an official religion or favoring one religion over others. The Free Exercise Clause protects the right of individuals to practice their faith without government interference.

Together, they create what Jefferson calls "a wall of separation between Church and State."

This is not an attack on religion. Many of the Founders are religious men who believe faith is essential to morality and public virtue. But they also believe that religion flourishes best when government keeps its hands off. Established churches grow lazy and corrupt. Persecuted faiths breed martyrs and resentment. True faith must be freely chosen, not compelled.

Father understands this better than anyone. In prison, he saw how government involvement corrupted both religion and government. The Anglican Church in Virginia was wealthy and powerful — but spiritually dead. The Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians, despite persecution, were alive with zeal.

"When government supports religion," Father tells me, "religion becomes a tool of government. When government persecutes religion, religion becomes a weapon against government. Only separation lets religion be what it should be: a matter between each soul and God."

Chapter Five. A New Experiment.

The American approach to religious freedom is an experiment. No large nation has ever tried complete separation of church and state. Many predict disaster — without an established church, they warn, religion will wither, morality will collapse, and society will fall into chaos.

I do not know what the future will bring. But I have seen what persecution does — it did not weaken my father's faith but strengthened it. And I have seen what establishment does — the Anglican ministers who imprisoned my father were comfortable but empty.

Perhaps freedom will prove the best policy for religion as well as politics. Perhaps when churches must persuade rather than compel, when faith must be freely given rather than forced, religion will flourish as it never has before.

Father is free now. He preaches wherever he wishes, to whoever will listen. Baptist churches are springing up across Virginia. The men who imprisoned him have lost their power.

"The Enlightenment gave us many gifts," Father says. "Natural rights. Self-government. Reason and science. But perhaps the greatest gift is this: the understanding that faith, to be genuine, must be free."

This concludes today's lesson. A Wall of Separation. Thank you for listening.
