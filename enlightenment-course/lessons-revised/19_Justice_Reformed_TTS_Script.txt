Welcome to today's history lesson. Justice Reformed. Cesare Beccaria and the Transformation of Criminal Law.

You will hear this story from Marco, a fifteen year old law student in Milan, seventeen sixty-four.

Chapter One. The Horror of the Old Justice.

My name is Marco, and I am fifteen years old. I am studying law in Milan, and what I have witnessed in our courts has filled me with horror.

Last week, I watched a man accused of theft. He was not proven guilty — there was only suspicion. Yet the judge ordered him stretched on the rack, his joints slowly torn apart, until he confessed. Of course he confessed. Anyone would confess anything to end such agony. Was his confession true? No one knows. No one cares.

This is justice in Europe in the year 1764. Torture is routine. Punishments are barbaric — branding, mutilation, public execution by burning, breaking on the wheel. The severity of punishment depends not on the crime but on the criminal's social rank. A noble who murders a peasant may pay a fine; a peasant who steals from a noble may be hanged.

But something is changing. A young Milanese nobleman named Cesare Beccaria has just published a small book that is causing a sensation across Europe. It is called Dei delitti e delle pene — On Crimes and Punishments. And in its pages, Beccaria applies Enlightenment principles to the horror of criminal justice.

When I obtained a copy, I knew I was reading something that could change the world.

Chapter Two. The Purpose of Punishment.

Beccaria asks a simple question that no one before him has asked so clearly: What is the purpose of punishment?

The old answer is revenge — the criminal has done wrong and must suffer. Punishment is about making the offender pay, often in the most gruesome ways imaginable. The worse the suffering, people think, the more justice is served.

Beccaria rejects this entirely. Punishment should not be about revenge but about prevention. The only legitimate purpose of punishment is to deter future crimes — to prevent the criminal from offending again and to discourage others from committing similar crimes.

If this is the purpose, then the form of punishment matters greatly. It must be severe enough to outweigh the pleasure or benefit of the crime, but no more severe than necessary. Excessive cruelty serves no purpose. It does not make people safer; it only brutalizes society.

"It is better to prevent crimes than to punish them," Beccaria writes. "This is the fundamental principle of good legislation." A wise government will address the causes of crime — poverty, ignorance, desperation — rather than simply punishing the results.

This is revolutionary. For centuries, governments have competed to devise the most horrific punishments, believing that terror will suppress crime. Beccaria shows that this approach is not only cruel but ineffective.

Chapter Three. Against Torture.

Beccaria's attack on torture is devastating. He shows, step by step, that torture is irrational as well as inhumane.

Torture, he points out, punishes before guilt is established. How can we call it justice to inflict agony on someone who might be innocent? The pain is the same whether the accused is guilty or not.

Worse, torture produces unreliable evidence. The strong and hardened criminal can endure pain and maintain a lie. The weak and sensitive innocent will confess to anything to make the suffering stop. Torture rewards the ability to endure pain, not truth-telling.

"By this method," Beccaria writes, "the robust will escape, and the feeble be condemned." The innocent man with a weak constitution is convicted; the guilty man with a strong one goes free. This is not justice — it is barbarism dressed in legal robes.

Beccaria also attacks the use of torture to extract the names of accomplices. Under torture, the accused will name anyone — friends, enemies, random acquaintances — hoping to satisfy the torturer. These names then become the basis for more arrests, more torture, more false confessions. Injustice multiplies.

My own professor, when he read this passage, fell silent for a long moment. "I have participated in such proceedings," he finally admitted. "I never questioned them. Beccaria has made me see what I was too blind to see."

Chapter Four. Proportionality and Certainty.

Beccaria establishes two principles that could reshape criminal justice everywhere.

First, proportionality: the punishment must fit the crime. Murder must be punished more severely than theft. Violence against persons more severely than property crimes. When all crimes are punished equally harshly — when a thief faces the same penalty as a murderer — the thief has no reason not to murder witnesses.

This seems obvious once stated, but in our time, hundreds of offenses carry the death penalty, from murder to petty theft to "speaking against the king." Beccaria argues that such a system is not only cruel but counterproductive.

Second, certainty: a moderate punishment that is certain to follow a crime deters more effectively than a severe punishment that might be escaped. If criminals know they will be caught and punished, even mild penalties deter. But if they believe they can escape justice, even the threat of death will not stop them.

This leads Beccaria to emphasize the importance of effective law enforcement over spectacular punishments. Swift and certain punishment is more valuable than cruel and uncertain punishment.

Chapter Five. The Death Penalty.

Beccaria's most controversial position is his opposition to the death penalty. Even among reformers, this is considered extreme.

He argues that the state, which exists to protect life, contradicts itself by taking life. He argues that long imprisonment deters as effectively as execution — perhaps more so, since the ongoing suffering of imprisonment is more present to the imagination than a quick death. He argues that irreversible punishments risk killing the innocent, and no system of justice is perfect.

"Is it not absurd," Beccaria asks, "that the laws which detest and punish homicide should, in order to prevent murder, publicly commit murder themselves?"

Not everyone is convinced. Many argue that some crimes are so terrible that only death is proportionate. But Beccaria has opened a debate that will continue for generations.

His influence is spreading rapidly. Voltaire has already written a commentary on On Crimes and Punishments. Rulers across Europe are reading it. Some are beginning to question whether the old ways of justice can be defended.

I am still studying law. The courts of Milan still use torture, though less confidently now. Change will come slowly. But I have seen a better way in Beccaria's pages, and I know that the barbarism of the present cannot endure forever. Reason has shown us what justice could be.

This concludes today's lesson. Justice Reformed. Thank you for listening.
