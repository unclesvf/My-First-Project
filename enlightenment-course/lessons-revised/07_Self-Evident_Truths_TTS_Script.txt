Welcome to today's history lesson. Self-Evident Truths. Thomas Jefferson and the Declaration of Independence.

You will hear this story from Samuel, a sixteen year old clerk in Philadelphia, July seventeen seventy-six.

Chapter One. The Committee's Choice.

My name is Samuel, and I am sixteen years old. I work as a clerk for a printer near the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia, and I am living through the most extraordinary days in the history of the American colonies.

It is July 1776, and everything is about to change.

The Continental Congress has been meeting in the State House for weeks, debating whether to declare independence from Britain. Just days ago, they voted in favor — the break is decided. But now they face an equally important task: explaining to the world why.

A committee of five men has been appointed to draft a declaration: Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, and a tall, red-haired Virginian named Thomas Jefferson. Though he is only thirty-three years old, Jefferson has been chosen to write the first draft.

"Why Jefferson?" I asked my employer. "Surely Mr. Adams or Dr. Franklin would be the natural choice."

"Jefferson has a gift for words," he replied. "Adams said Jefferson writes with a 'peculiar felicity of expression.' And Adams, clever man that he is, also knows that if Virginia — the largest colony — is to be fully committed to independence, a Virginian should write the document that declares it."

So it falls to Thomas Jefferson to put into words what the American Revolution means — not just for the colonies, but for all of humanity.

Chapter Two. Writing in the Parlor.

Jefferson has rented rooms on the second floor of a brick house on Market Street, just blocks from where I work. I have glimpsed him through the window, bent over his portable writing desk, quill in hand.

He writes in a small parlor, sitting in a Windsor chair. The desk — which he designed himself — rests on his lap. Crumpled drafts litter the floor around him. He writes, crosses out, writes again. The words must be perfect.

From whispered conversations I've overheard, I know something of what Jefferson is attempting. He is not merely listing grievances against King George III, though the Declaration will contain many. He is trying to explain the philosophical foundations of the American cause.

Jefferson, like Franklin and Adams, is steeped in Enlightenment philosophy. He has read John Locke's Two Treatises of Government until he knows it almost by heart. Locke's ideas about natural rights, the social contract, and the right of revolution form the backbone of Jefferson's thinking.

But Jefferson is not merely copying Locke. He is distilling a century of Enlightenment thought into a document that ordinary people can understand and remember. He is trying to write sentences that will ring through the ages.

The pressure must be immense. And yet, within just seventeen days, Thomas Jefferson will produce one of the most important documents in human history.

Chapter Three. The Immortal Preamble.

When the draft was finally shared with Congress, I was fortunate enough to hear portions read aloud. The opening words took my breath away:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

I recognized the echo of John Locke immediately — "life, liberty, and property." But Jefferson had changed "property" to "the pursuit of Happiness." It was a profound alteration. The new phrase suggests that government's purpose is not merely to protect what people own, but to enable them to flourish as human beings.

The Declaration continued: "That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."

There it was — Locke's social contract theory, simplified and clarified. Governments exist to protect our rights. Their authority comes from us. They serve us, not the other way around.

"That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government..."

Locke's right of revolution, stated plainly. If a government fails to protect our rights — if it becomes tyrannical — we have the right to change it. We are not bound to suffer under unjust rule.

These were not new ideas. But Jefferson had expressed them with a clarity and force that made them feel inevitable, unchallengeable — "self-evident."

Chapter Four. A Long Train of Abuses.

The preamble established the principles. The body of the Declaration applied them to the specific case of the American colonies.

Jefferson listed grievance after grievance against King George III — a "long train of abuses" that proved the British government had broken the social contract. The King had dissolved representative legislatures. He had imposed taxes without consent. He had quartered soldiers in people's homes. He had cut off trade. He had waged war against the colonies.

Each charge connected to the Enlightenment principles in the preamble. If governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed, then taxation without representation is illegitimate. If the purpose of government is to protect rights, then a government that attacks its own citizens has forfeited its authority.

The logic was relentless. Jefferson was not merely complaining about British policies. He was building a philosophical case that the colonies had both the right and the duty to separate.

But the Declaration was not addressed only to King George. Jefferson wrote for posterity — for future generations who would need to understand why America had declared independence. And he wrote for the world, inviting other peoples to judge whether the American cause was just.

Chapter Five. Words That Changed the World.

On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. Two days later, it was publicly read for the first time in Philadelphia, and church bells rang throughout the city.

I stood in the crowd that day, listening to the words Jefferson had labored over in his rented parlor. Around me, people cheered, wept, and embraced. We all understood that something momentous had happened — not just the break with Britain, but the proclamation of a new kind of nation, founded on Enlightenment principles.

"All men are created equal." I wonder what those words will mean in the years to come. Will they apply only to men like those in Congress — white, propertied, educated? Or will future generations see them differently, apply them more broadly?

Jefferson himself owns slaves. I know this. Many of the men who signed the Declaration do. The contradiction troubles me, though I cannot fully explain why. If all men are truly created equal, what does that mean for the enslaved?

I do not know how history will judge us. But I know I am witnessing something that will matter for a very long time. The Enlightenment philosophers developed these ideas. Benjamin Franklin nurtured them in America. And Thomas Jefferson has given them their most memorable expression.

Standing in the Philadelphia crowd on this July day, I cannot know all that will follow. But I know the world has changed.

This concludes today's lesson. Self-Evident Truths. Thank you for listening.
