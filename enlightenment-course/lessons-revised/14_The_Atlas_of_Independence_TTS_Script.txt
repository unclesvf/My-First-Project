Welcome to today's history lesson. The Atlas of Independence. John Adams: Revolutionary, Diplomat, and Constitutional Thinker.

You will hear this story from Abigail, a fifteen year old niece of Abigail Adams, in Braintree, eighteen hundred.

Chapter One. The Unsung Founder.

My name is Abigail, named after my famous aunt, and I am fifteen years old. I live in Braintree, Massachusetts, where my uncle John Adams will soon return after completing his term as President of the United States.

Uncle John is not the most popular of the Founders. He lacks General Washington's commanding presence, Dr. Franklin's charm, and Mr. Jefferson's elegant pen. He is blunt, sometimes vain, and honest to a fault. "I am not of Caesar's mind," he once wrote. "The second place in Rome is high enough for me."

Yet my aunt tells me that without John Adams, there might have been no American independence at all.

It was Uncle John who pushed the Continental Congress toward declaring independence when others hesitated. It was Uncle John who nominated George Washington to command the army. It was Uncle John who spent years in Europe securing loans and alliances that made victory possible. It was Uncle John who helped negotiate the peace treaty with Britain.

Thomas Jefferson, who has become Uncle John's great rival, once called him "the colossus of that Congress" and "the pillar of its support on the floor."

Yet few remember him as they remember Washington or Jefferson. Perhaps that is the fate of those who build foundations rather than monuments.

Chapter Two. The Lawyer Who Defended the Redcoats.

Aunt Abigail tells me that to understand Uncle John, I must understand one moment from before the Revolution: his defense of the British soldiers after the Boston Massacre.

In March 1770, British soldiers fired into a crowd of angry colonists, killing five. All of Boston demanded blood. The soldiers were charged with murder. And John Adams — a passionate patriot who had already written eloquent protests against British tyranny — agreed to defend them.

His friends were shocked. His reputation was at risk. But Uncle John believed that even enemies of liberty deserved a fair trial.

"Facts are stubborn things," he told the jury, "and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence."

He proved that the soldiers had been surrounded by a threatening mob, that they reasonably feared for their lives, that the command to fire may not have come from their captain. Six soldiers were acquitted. Two were convicted of manslaughter, not murder.

Uncle John lost clients and faced hostility for years. But he had established something vital: in America, the rule of law would prevail over the passions of the mob. Even in pursuit of independence, we would not abandon justice.

"Counsel ought to be the very last thing that an accused Person should want in a free Country," he wrote. This principle — that everyone deserves legal defense — is now enshrined in the Sixth Amendment.

Chapter Three. The Architect of Constitutions.

While Jefferson is famous for the Declaration of Independence, Uncle John's greatest contribution may be his work on constitutions — the practical architecture of self-government.

In 1776, when the Continental Congress asked each colony to form new state governments, several turned to John Adams for guidance. He wrote Thoughts on Government, a pamphlet explaining how republics should be structured.

Adams argued for separation of powers — independent legislative, executive, and judicial branches. He advocated for a two-house legislature: a popular assembly and a senate of more deliberate, experienced members. He called for an independent judiciary with judges serving during good behavior, not at the pleasure of the executive.

These ideas drew on Montesquieu but adapted them for American circumstances. When Massachusetts needed a new constitution in 1780, John Adams wrote most of it himself. The Massachusetts Constitution, the oldest written constitution still in effect anywhere in the world, became a model for the federal Constitution.

"A government of laws, and not of men," Adams wrote. The power of government must reside in written laws and balanced institutions, not in the arbitrary will of any person.

Chapter Four. The Diplomat.

During the Revolutionary War, Uncle John served America in Europe under conditions of extraordinary difficulty.

He crossed the Atlantic multiple times in dangerous wartime voyages. He negotiated loans from Dutch bankers that kept the Continental Army supplied when Congress was bankrupt. He represented American interests at courts where kings and aristocrats looked down on republican upstarts.

Alongside Benjamin Franklin and John Jay, he negotiated the Treaty of Paris that ended the war and recognized American independence. He insisted, over French objections, on favorable boundaries for the new nation — boundaries that would later allow America to expand westward.

Aunt Abigail tells me these years were the loneliest of her life. She and Uncle John were separated for years at a time. She managed the farm, raised the children, and endured the uncertainty of war while he labored across the ocean.

"Remember the Ladies," she famously wrote to him during the Continental Congress. She urged that women not be forgotten in the new republic. Uncle John, unfortunately, treated her plea as a joke. Even the most enlightened men of his generation had blind spots.

But Aunt Abigail persisted. She was her husband's closest advisor, his intellectual equal, and the person who kept their family together through decades of public service. "If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies," she warned, "we are determined to foment a Rebellion."

Chapter Five. A Presidency of Principle.

Uncle John became President in 1797, following George Washington. It was a difficult time — France and Britain were at war, and both tried to drag America into their conflict. Hamilton's Federalists wanted war with France; Jefferson's Republicans sympathized with the French Revolution.

Uncle John chose peace. He sent diplomats to negotiate with France, even though it was politically unpopular and split his own party. "I desire no other inscription over my gravestone," he later said, "than: 'Here lies John Adams, who took upon himself the responsibility of the peace with France in the year 1800.'"

This decision probably cost him reelection. He lost to Thomas Jefferson. But he had kept America out of a war that could have destroyed the young republic.

His presidency was not without failures. The Alien and Sedition Acts, which he signed, allowed the government to prosecute critics. These laws violated the very principles of free speech that Adams himself cherished, and they remain a stain on his legacy. Even great men make terrible mistakes.

Yet when he lost the election, Uncle John did something extraordinary: he peacefully handed power to his political opponent. This peaceful transfer of power — the first between opposing parties in American history — established a precedent as important as any in the Constitution.

As I prepare to welcome Uncle John home to Braintree, I think about what his life teaches us. He was brilliant but flawed, principled but sometimes rigid. He served his country for forty years and received more criticism than gratitude.

But he helped build a nation on Enlightenment foundations: rule of law, separation of powers, written constitutions, and the peaceful resolution of political disputes. That is his monument — more lasting than any statue.
