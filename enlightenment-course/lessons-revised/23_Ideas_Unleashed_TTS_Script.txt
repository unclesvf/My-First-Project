Welcome to today's history lesson. Ideas Unleashed. The French Revolution and the Dangers of Enlightenment Without Restraint.

You will hear this story from Pierre, a fifteen year old apprentice printer in Paris, seventeen ninety-three.

Chapter One. The World Turned Upside Down.

My name is Pierre, and I am fifteen years old. I work in a print shop in Paris, and I have watched my city — my country — transform beyond recognition in just four years.

In 1789, the people stormed the Bastille. They declared the Rights of Man. They abolished the feudal system that had oppressed France for centuries. Enlightenment ideas that philosophers had debated in salons became reality in the streets.

But now, in 1793, the Revolution has become something else entirely. The king is dead, executed by guillotine. The queen will soon follow. And every day, the blade falls on new necks — nobles, priests, but increasingly, revolutionaries themselves.

The print shop where I work produces proclamations for the Committee of Public Safety. We print accusations, denunciations, death sentences. The words of Voltaire and Rousseau that once inspired hope for a new world now justify terror.

How did the philosophy of reason lead to the madness of the guillotine? How did the promise of liberty become the reality of tyranny? These questions haunt me as I set the type that sends my countrymen to their deaths.

Chapter Two. Rousseau's Children.

The revolutionaries worship Rousseau. They have moved his remains to the Panthéon, the temple of France's great men. Robespierre keeps a copy of the Social Contract by his bedside.

But have they understood him? Rousseau spoke of the "general will" — the common good that transcends individual interests. But who determines the general will? The revolutionaries claim that they embody it. Anyone who disagrees is not merely wrong but an enemy of the people, a traitor to the nation.

Rousseau warned that freedom could become tyranny when rulers claimed to act for the general will while ignoring the actual wishes of citizens. But the Revolution has made the general will into a weapon. If you are denounced, your individual protestations mean nothing. The will of the nation demands your death.

I remember my father, before his arrest, saying: "Rousseau wanted to free humanity. But his followers have made freedom compulsory — and the punishment for refusing it is death."

The great philosophers never intended this. Voltaire would have been horrified by the suppression of free speech in the name of revolutionary purity. Locke would have condemned the seizure of property without due process. But ideas, once released into the world, cannot be controlled. They are interpreted, distorted, weaponized.

Chapter Three. The Terror.

They call it the Reign of Terror, though those who rule insist it is necessary for the survival of the Revolution. Robespierre speaks of "virtue and terror" — terror is the instrument of virtue, he says. To be merciful to the enemies of the people is to be cruel to the people themselves.

The Law of Suspects allows arrest without evidence. The Revolutionary Tribunal condemns without proper trials. The guillotine works so constantly that executioners have become experts, timing each death to the second.

In September alone, they executed over 16,000 people. Not just aristocrats — peasants, workers, priests, children. The Revolution devours its own. Danton, who once led the people, has been executed. Desmoulins, who called for the storming of the Bastille, has been executed. Those who show mercy are accused of treason.

I print their death sentences. I set in type the accusations: "enemy of the people," "counter-revolutionary," "traitor to the Republic." The words have lost all meaning. They have become formulas for murder.

And yet — the revolutionaries believe they are saving humanity. They believe they are building a new world based on reason and virtue. How can such noble intentions produce such horror?

Chapter Four. Americans Watch in Horror.

The news from France has shocked America. When the Revolution began, most Americans celebrated. Lafayette, who fought for American independence, was leading France toward liberty. The Declaration of the Rights of Man echoed Jefferson's own words.

But now? Thomas Jefferson, once the Revolution's greatest American defender, has grown quiet. John Adams, who always suspected French radicalism, feels vindicated in his warnings. George Washington has declared American neutrality — the young republic will not be dragged into France's wars.

What Americans are learning from France is what can happen when Enlightenment ideas are taken to extremes without the restraints of law, tradition, and moderation.

The American Revolution succeeded because men like Washington, Adams, and Madison understood limits. They created checks and balances. They protected individual rights against majority tyranny. They distrusted absolute power even when wielded in the name of the people.

The French Revolution has no such restraints. The National Convention holds all power. The Committee of Public Safety answers to no one. Individual rights dissolve before the "general will." There is no separation of powers, no independent judiciary, no Bill of Rights to protect the accused.

The Enlightenment gave both revolutions their ideals. But the American Revolution tempered those ideals with practical wisdom. The French Revolution drove them to their logical extremes — and discovered that logic without mercy is madness.

Chapter Five. After the Storm.

I do not know how this will end. The guillotine still falls every day. Robespierre still speaks of virtue. The prisons are full, and the tribunals work without rest.

But I have learned something that the philosophers did not teach me. Ideas alone cannot save us. Reason alone cannot govern human affairs. Virtue cannot be imposed by terror. The general will is not whatever the powerful say it is.

What America's Founders understood — what France forgot — is that rights must be protected against majorities as well as kings. Power must be divided, not concentrated. Even those who claim to act for the people must be restrained by law.

The Enlightenment taught us to question authority. But it also teaches us to question ourselves — especially when we hold power over others. The Revolution promised liberty, equality, fraternity. It has delivered terror, suspicion, death.

Someday, perhaps, France will find its way to a government that honors Enlightenment ideals while protecting against their abuse. Someday the principles of the Rights of Man will be applied with wisdom and restraint.

But today, I print the death sentences. And I wonder how many more must die before we learn that good intentions, without limits, can become the greatest evil of all.

This concludes today's lesson. Ideas Unleashed. Thank you for listening.
