Welcome to today's history lesson. The Wealth of Nations. Adam Smith and the Birth of Modern Economics.

You will hear this story from James, a fourteen year old apprentice to a Glasgow merchant, seventeen seventy-six.

Chapter One. The Professor's Great Book.

My name is James, and I am fourteen years old. I serve as an apprentice to a merchant in Glasgow, Scotland, learning the trade that I hope will one day make my fortune. And this year of 1776, while the American colonies are declaring their independence across the Atlantic, something equally revolutionary is happening right here in Britain.

A professor named Adam Smith has published a massive book called An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. My master, Mr. Campbell, has been reading it aloud in the evenings, and he says it will change how the world thinks about commerce, trade, and prosperity.

"This book," Mr. Campbell declared, tapping the thick volume, "explains what we merchants have always sensed but could never quite put into words. It shows how the pursuit of self-interest, properly channeled, can benefit everyone."

I know something of Adam Smith already. He was a professor at the University of Glasgow before spending years as a tutor to a young duke, traveling across Europe and meeting the great philosophers of France. Now, after more than a decade of work, he has produced this monument of Enlightenment thinking applied to economics.

But what does it mean for a boy like me, hoping to make my way in the world of trade?

Chapter Two. The Invisible Hand.

The most famous idea in Smith's book is what he calls the "invisible hand." It sounds almost mystical, but the concept is really quite practical.

Imagine a baker, Smith suggests. The baker does not wake up each morning thinking, "How can I serve my community today?" No — the baker thinks about earning a living, providing for his family, making a profit. Yet in pursuing this self-interest, the baker produces bread that feeds his neighbors.

The same is true for the butcher, the brewer, the candlemaker. "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner," Smith writes, "but from their regard to their own interest."

Here is the remarkable insight: when many people pursue their own interests in a free market, an "invisible hand" guides their efforts toward outcomes that benefit society as a whole. No king or central planner needs to direct the economy. The price system, responding to supply and demand, coordinates millions of individual decisions far better than any human authority could.

Mr. Campbell explains this to me with our own trade. "When cloth is scarce, the price rises. That signals weavers to produce more. When it is abundant, the price falls, and weavers turn to other goods. No one commands this — it happens naturally, guided by prices that tell us what society needs."

This is revolutionary. For centuries, rulers have tried to manage economies through regulations, monopolies, and decrees. Smith argues that freedom produces better results.

Chapter Three. The Division of Labor.

Smith opens his book with another powerful insight: the division of labor. He uses the example of a pin factory.

One worker making pins alone, doing every step himself, might produce a handful of pins in a day. But divide the work — one person draws the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds the top for the head — and the same number of workers can produce thousands of pins.

"The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour," Smith writes, "seem to have been the effects of the division of labour."

I see this in Mr. Campbell's warehouse. Each clerk has specialized tasks. One keeps the accounts, another manages correspondence with suppliers, a third organizes the warehouse inventory. Together, we accomplish far more than if each person tried to do everything.

Smith connects this to the size of markets. Division of labor is limited, he explains, by the extent of the market. A village can support only a general blacksmith. A city can support specialists — one who makes only horseshoes, another only nails, another only locks. Trade expands markets, enabling greater specialization, which increases productivity, which creates more wealth.

This is why Smith opposes trade barriers and monopolies. They shrink markets and prevent the division of labor from reaching its full potential. Free trade between nations, like free exchange within nations, makes everyone richer.

Chapter Four. Against Mercantilism.

Smith writes his book partly to attack the economic system that dominates his era: mercantilism. Mercantilist thinking holds that wealth is a fixed quantity of gold and silver, and that nations grow rich by hoarding precious metals and running trade surpluses.

Governments enact endless regulations to achieve these goals. They grant monopolies to favored companies. They ban the export of gold and the import of manufactured goods. They require colonies to trade only with the mother country.

Smith argues that this is all wrong. Wealth is not gold sitting in a vault — wealth is the goods and services that improve people's lives. A nation grows wealthy not by hoarding metal but by producing more of what people want.

"Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production," Smith writes. The goal of economic activity is to satisfy human wants. Policies that enrich a few merchants while impoverishing consumers are foolish.

This has direct implications for Britain's American colonies. Mercantilist policies restrict colonial trade, forcing Americans to buy from British merchants at high prices and sell their products only to Britain at low prices. Smith sympathizes with colonial grievances. He even suggests that the colonies might be better off independent — advice that is, at this very moment, being tested across the Atlantic.

Chapter Five. Liberty and Prosperity.

What strikes me most about Smith's work is how it connects economics to the broader ideas of the Enlightenment. Just as Locke argued for natural rights and Montesquieu for limited government, Smith argues for economic liberty.

"Every man, as long as he does not violate the laws of justice," Smith writes, "is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest his own way, and to bring both his industry and capital into competition with those of any other man."

This is a vision of freedom — not just political freedom, but the freedom to work, trade, and prosper without arbitrary interference from government. The same Enlightenment principles that demand representative government and natural rights also demand free markets.

Smith does not argue for no government at all. He believes the state should provide defense, justice, and certain public works that private enterprise would not undertake — roads, canals, education. But beyond these essential functions, government should step back and let the invisible hand work.

I am only fourteen, but I can sense that something important is happening in the world. The same year that Americans declare their independence based on natural rights, a Scottish professor explains how economic freedom creates prosperity. These ideas feel connected — liberty in politics, liberty in commerce. Both flowing from the same Enlightenment belief that people, left free to pursue their own good, will build a better world than any king or planner could design.

I do not know where these ideas will lead. But I am learning a trade in a world that is beginning to understand itself differently. That feels like the right place to be.

This concludes today's lesson. The Wealth of Nations. Thank you for listening.
