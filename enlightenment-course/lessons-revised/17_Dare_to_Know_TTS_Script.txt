Welcome to today's history lesson. Dare to Know. Immanuel Kant and the Philosophy of Enlightenment.

You will hear this story from Friedrich, a fifteen year old university student in Königsberg, seventeen eighty-four.

Chapter One. The Professor's Daily Walk.

My name is Friedrich, and I am fifteen years old. I am a student at the University of Königsberg in Prussia, and I have the privilege of living in the same city as the greatest philosopher of our age: Immanuel Kant.

Professor Kant is a man of extraordinary habits. Every afternoon at precisely half past three, he walks the same route through the city. The housewives of Königsberg set their clocks by his passing. He has never married, rarely travels, and lives a life of almost monastic simplicity. Yet from his small study, he has produced ideas that are reshaping how humanity thinks about knowledge, morality, and reason itself.

This year of 1784, Professor Kant has published an essay that has become the talk of every salon and university in Europe. It answers a deceptively simple question posed by a Berlin magazine: "What is Enlightenment?"

My tutor, Herr Müller, obtained a copy for me. "Read this carefully, Friedrich," he said. "In these few pages, Kant captures the essence of the age we are living through. He tells us what the Enlightenment truly means — and what it demands of each of us."

I opened the essay and read words that would change how I understand my place in the world.

Chapter Two. Sapere Aude.

Kant begins his essay with a definition that struck me like a thunderbolt: "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity."

Self-imposed immaturity? What could that mean?

Kant explains that immaturity is the inability to use one's own understanding without guidance from another. And it is self-imposed when the cause is not lack of intelligence but lack of courage. We are immature when we let others think for us — when we accept what authorities tell us without examining it ourselves.

"Sapere aude!" Kant declares — "Dare to know! Have courage to use your own understanding!" This, he says, is the motto of the Enlightenment.

I thought about my own education. How often had I simply accepted what my teachers said because they were teachers? How often had I repeated ideas without truly understanding them? Kant was challenging me — challenging everyone — to think independently, to question, to reason for ourselves.

This does not mean rejecting all guidance or tradition. But it means examining beliefs rather than blindly accepting them. It means taking responsibility for our own conclusions. It means having the courage to think.

Herr Müller smiled when I shared my reflections. "Now you begin to understand," he said. "The Enlightenment is not just a movement of philosophers. It is a challenge to every individual to become intellectually mature."

Chapter Three. The Guardians of Immaturity.

Kant identifies the forces that keep people in intellectual immaturity. He calls them "guardians" — authorities who prefer that people not think for themselves.

"It is so convenient to be immature!" Kant writes with sharp irony. "If I have a book to think for me, a pastor to act as my conscience, a physician to decide my diet, I need not exert myself at all."

These guardians — whether political, religious, or social — often discourage independent thought because it threatens their power. They tell people that thinking is dangerous, that questioning is sinful, that obedience is virtue. And many people accept this because thinking is difficult, while obedience is easy.

But Kant argues that while any individual might struggle to break free, a public that is allowed to discuss and debate freely will gradually enlighten itself. "For this enlightenment, nothing is required but freedom — and the most harmless form of freedom: to make public use of one's reason in all matters."

This is why censorship is so dangerous. When authorities ban books, suppress debate, and punish dissent, they prevent the public from reasoning together. They keep entire societies in immaturity.

I think about the banned books that circulate secretly through Europe — Voltaire's satires, Rousseau's political philosophy, the volumes of the Encyclopédie. Governments fear these books precisely because they encourage people to think for themselves.

Chapter Four. Reason and Its Limits.

Professor Kant is not naive about the challenges of enlightenment. He distinguishes between the "public use" and "private use" of reason.

In our public capacity — as scholars, writers, citizens — we must be free to reason openly and criticize anything. A clergyman must be free to publish his philosophical doubts about church doctrine. A soldier must be free to write about the flaws in military policy.

But in our private capacity — performing the duties of our office or position — we may need to obey rules we personally question. The clergyman must still teach the church's catechism; the soldier must still follow orders in battle. Society requires this discipline to function.

This distinction troubled me at first. Was Kant telling us to be hypocrites — to think one thing and do another?

Herr Müller helped me understand. "Kant is being practical," he explained. "A soldier who refuses orders in the middle of battle creates chaos. But a soldier who writes critically about military policy after the battle improves the army. The Enlightenment advances through public debate, not through individual disobedience in the moment of duty."

Kant believes we are living in an age of enlightenment, though not yet an enlightened age. The process is underway, but it takes time. Generations must pass before the habits of free thinking become widespread.

Chapter Five. The Moral Law Within.

As I continue my studies, I am learning that Kant's essay on enlightenment is just one small part of his vast philosophical work. His greatest writings examine the very foundations of human knowledge and morality.

Kant argues that human reason has both powers and limits. We can know the world as it appears to us, structured by the categories of our minds. But we cannot know things as they are in themselves, beyond our experience. This humility about reason's limits is itself an Enlightenment achievement.

Yet in morality, Kant finds something absolute. He calls it the "categorical imperative" — the unconditional moral law that reason discovers within itself. One way he puts it: "Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

In other words: before acting, ask yourself whether you could consistently want everyone to act the same way. Could you want everyone to lie? To break promises? To treat others as mere tools? If not, then such actions are morally wrong.

This moral law, Kant believes, is the foundation of human dignity. Every rational being has infinite worth — not as a means to someone else's ends, but as an end in themselves.

As I walk home past the professor's house each evening, I remind myself of what he has taught me: enlightenment is not a destination but a journey, not a gift received but a courage exercised. The responsibility to think is mine. No one else can do it for me.

Dare to know. That is the challenge. And I am trying to rise to meet it.

This concludes today's lesson. Dare to Know. Thank you for listening.
