Welcome to today's history lesson. A Vindication. Mary Wollstonecraft and the Rights of Women.

You will hear this story from Elizabeth, a sixteen year old governess in London, seventeen ninety-two.

Chapter One. The Book That Shocked London.

My name is Elizabeth, and I am sixteen years old. I work as a governess — a teacher of young children — in the household of a wealthy London merchant. It is respectable work for a woman of my circumstances, but it is also a cage.

This year of 1792, however, a book has appeared that makes me dream of a different world. It is called A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, and its author is a woman named Mary Wollstonecraft.

The book has caused a sensation. In drawing rooms across London, gentlemen sneer and ladies gasp. How dare a woman write about politics? How dare she demand that women be treated as rational beings, capable of education and independent thought?

But among governesses like me, among women who read and think despite being told we should not, Mary Wollstonecraft has become a hero. She has dared to ask the question that the Enlightenment philosophers — for all their talk of natural rights and human equality — somehow never asked: If all men are created equal, what about women?

I obtained a copy through a sympathetic bookseller, and I read it by candlelight after my charges are asleep. What I find is changing how I see the world.

Chapter Two. The Enlightenment's Blind Spot.

Wollstonecraft begins by pointing out a glaring contradiction. The philosophers of the Enlightenment have argued that all human beings possess reason, and that reason is what gives us dignity and rights. They have attacked tyranny, arguing that no person should be subject to the arbitrary will of another.

Yet these same philosophers accept, almost without question, the subordination of women to men.

Rousseau, whom Wollstonecraft otherwise admires, wrote that women should be educated only to please men. "The whole education of women ought to be relative to men," Rousseau declared. "To please them, to be useful to them, to make themselves loved and honored by them... these are the duties of women at all times."

Wollstonecraft is outraged. "If women be not prepared by education to become the companion of man," she demands, "she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue." To limit women's education is not just unfair — it is foolish. It wastes half of humanity's potential.

"I do not wish women to have power over men," she writes, "but over themselves." This is the core of her argument: women deserve the same rational education as men, the same opportunity to develop their minds, the same recognition as thinking, feeling, dignified human beings.

Chapter Three. The Chains of Fashion and Ignorance.

Wollstonecraft does not simply blame men for women's condition. She also criticizes women who accept their subordination — who care only for fashion and frivolity, who cultivate weakness as a virtue, who make themselves ornaments rather than persons.

But she understands why this happens. Women are not born weak and silly — they are made that way by their education, or rather, their lack of education.

"Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre," she writes, "the mind shapes itself to the body, and roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison."

Girls are taught to catch husbands, not to develop their minds. They are trained in music, drawing, and needlework — accomplishments designed to attract suitors — but denied access to serious learning. They are told that thinking deeply is unfeminine, that ambition is unseemly, that their purpose is to please men and bear children.

No wonder, then, that many women seem to confirm the prejudices against them. They have never been given the chance to be anything else.

"Make women rational creatures and free citizens," Wollstonecraft argues, "and they will quickly become good wives and mothers." Educated women will be better companions, better parents, better citizens. Everyone will benefit.

Chapter Four. Rights and Duties.

Wollstonecraft grounds her argument in the same Enlightenment principles that justify the American and French Revolutions. If human beings have natural rights because they possess reason, then women — who also possess reason — must have the same rights as men.

"Who made man the exclusive judge," she demands, "if woman partake with him the gift of reason?"

She connects political rights to moral responsibility. If women are denied education and independence, how can they be held responsible for their actions? Only by treating women as rational agents, capable of making their own decisions, can society hold them to moral standards.

"It is vain to expect virtue from women till they are, in some degree, independent of men," she writes. A woman who depends entirely on a man for survival will inevitably become either his slave or his manipulator. Only independence can produce true virtue.

Wollstonecraft calls for radical reforms: equal education for boys and girls, women's admission to the professions, legal reforms to protect women's property rights and end their total subjection in marriage. Some of these demands will not be achieved for over a century — and some remain contested even now.

But the principle is clear: the Enlightenment's promise of liberty and equality must extend to all human beings, regardless of sex.

Chapter Five. A Seed That Cannot Be Uprooted.

I do not know what will become of Mary Wollstonecraft or her ideas. She has powerful enemies — men who mock her, women who fear her, a society that finds her dangerous.

But I know this: once an idea is spoken, it cannot be unspoken. Once a question is asked, it hangs in the air waiting to be answered. If reason is the basis of human dignity, if natural rights belong to all who possess reason, then the exclusion of women from liberty and equality is a contradiction that must eventually be resolved.

In America, women like Abigail Adams have already sensed what Wollstonecraft articulates. "Remember the Ladies," Abigail famously wrote to her husband John during the Continental Congress. She warned that women "will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation."

The new American Constitution, for all its Enlightenment principles, does not give women the vote. I wonder how long that contradiction can last.

I close her book each night knowing that I live in a cage — but knowing also that the bars are made by human hands and can be broken by human effort. That is what the Enlightenment truly means: the belief that we can reason our way to a better world, that traditions of injustice need not endure forever, that even a governess can dream of freedom.

Mary Wollstonecraft has planted a seed. I do not know what tree will grow from it, but I know it cannot be uprooted.

This concludes today's lesson. A Vindication. Thank you for listening.
