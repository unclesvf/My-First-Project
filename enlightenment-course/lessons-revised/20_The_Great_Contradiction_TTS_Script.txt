Welcome to today's history lesson. The Great Contradiction. The Enlightenment, Slavery, and America's Unfinished Revolution.

You will hear this story from James, a sixteen year old free Black apprentice in Philadelphia, seventeen eighty-seven.

Chapter One. Words That Haunted Me.

My name is James, and I am sixteen years old. I am a free Black man — my mother earned her freedom before I was born — and I work as an apprentice to a printer in Philadelphia. I can read and write, skills many in my position are denied.

This summer of 1787, the greatest minds in America have gathered in the State House just blocks from where I work. They are writing a new Constitution — a document that will, they say, secure liberty for all Americans.

But every day, as I set type and deliver papers, I am haunted by a question: What do their words mean for people who look like me?

I have read the Declaration of Independence. I know its words by heart: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights."

All men. Created equal. Unalienable rights.

Yet the man who wrote those words — Thomas Jefferson — holds more than a hundred people in bondage at his Virginia plantation. George Washington, who presides over the Constitutional Convention, holds over three hundred enslaved people. Many of the delegates debating liberty inside that hall profit from human beings bought and sold like cattle.

How can this be? How can men who speak of natural rights and human equality hold other humans in chains?

Chapter Two. The Philosophers' Silence.

I have read many of the Enlightenment philosophers in my master's shop. They speak beautifully of human dignity, natural rights, the equality of all people. Yet on slavery, many are silent — or worse.

John Locke wrote that all men have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. But Locke invested in the slave trade and helped write the Constitution of Carolina, which gave masters absolute power over their enslaved workers.

Montesquieu, in his Spirit of the Laws, criticized slavery as contrary to natural law. Yet he stopped short of demanding its abolition. He analyzed it, deplored it, but did not act.

Some philosophers do speak clearly. The Marquis de Condorcet in France calls slavery a crime and demands immediate abolition. The Quakers of Philadelphia, guided by their faith, have freed their enslaved workers and campaign against the trade. Benjamin Rush, a Philadelphia physician, publishes pamphlets calling slavery incompatible with Christianity and natural law.

But these are voices in the wilderness. The great weight of Enlightenment Europe does not rise to end the slave trade that enriches its nations. The great weight of Enlightenment America does not insist that liberty means liberty for all.

I asked my master once how Jefferson could write of equality while holding people in bondage. He sighed heavily. "Men are capable of believing two contradictory things at once," he said. "Especially when one of those beliefs costs them nothing and the other would cost them everything."

Chapter Three. The Constitutional Compromise.

As the Convention proceeds, I learn of the terrible bargains being struck inside.

The Southern states — Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia — have made clear they will not join any union that threatens slavery. The new nation needs their population, their wealth, their commitment. And so the Constitution will protect slavery without ever using the word.

The Three-Fifths Clause: for purposes of representation and taxation, an enslaved person will count as three-fifths of a free person. This gives slave states extra power in Congress without giving enslaved people any rights at all. They are counted but not considered.

The Fugitive Slave Clause: enslaved people who escape to free states must be returned to their masters. Freedom in the North will not mean safety for those who flee bondage in the South.

The Slave Trade Clause: Congress cannot ban the importation of enslaved people until 1808 — twenty years away. For two more decades, ships will cross the Atlantic packed with human beings in chains.

Some delegates protest. Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania calls slavery "a nefarious institution" and warns that it will bring divine judgment on the nation. But the protests fail. The Constitution is ratified with slavery embedded in its structure.

I weep when I learn of these compromises. The new nation born from Enlightenment ideals will carry the poison of slavery in its blood.

Chapter Four. Those Who Fight.

Yet even in this darkness, there are lights.

In Philadelphia, free Black men and women are building institutions — churches, schools, mutual aid societies — that will sustain our community through whatever struggle lies ahead. Richard Allen is working toward what will become the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Absalom Jones leads the Free African Society.

In the North, state after state moves toward abolishing slavery. Vermont's constitution of 1777 banned it outright. Pennsylvania passed a gradual abolition law in 1780. Massachusetts courts have ruled slavery unconstitutional.

And among the enslaved themselves, resistance never ceases. They run away, sabotage work, maintain African traditions, teach each other to read despite the laws, and dream of freedom.

Some Founders understand the contradiction and are troubled by it. Jefferson himself calls slavery a "moral and political depravity" even as he refuses to free those he holds. He writes that he trembles for his country when he reflects that God is just.

Benjamin Franklin, in these final years of his life, has become president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society and petitions Congress to end the slave trade.

The Enlightenment has planted seeds of equality that it fails to cultivate. But seeds, once planted, have a way of growing.

Chapter Five. The Unfinished Work.

I do not know what the future holds. I am sixteen years old, standing in a city where freedom and slavery exist side by side, watching men proclaim liberty while others remain in chains.

But I know this: the contradiction cannot last forever. "All men are created equal" — those words mean more than Jefferson intended. Natural rights belong to everyone or to no one. Once the principle is stated, it cannot be contained.

The great men meeting in that State House have built something imperfect. They have compromised with evil to create a union. Perhaps they had no choice. Perhaps they did what was possible rather than what was right.

But the words remain. The principles remain. And someday — I have to believe this — those words will be applied as they should be applied. Not just to men who look like the delegates in that hall, but to all people.

The work of the Enlightenment is not finished. It falls to those who come after to demand that America live up to its promises. To insist that liberty means liberty for everyone. To refuse to accept that some human beings are less human than others.

I do not know if I will see that day. But I believe it will come. The light of reason, once kindled, cannot be extinguished. And the promise of equality, once spoken, cannot be taken back.

This concludes today's lesson. The Great Contradiction. Thank you for listening.
