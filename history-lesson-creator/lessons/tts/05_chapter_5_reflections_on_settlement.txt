Chapter Five. Reflections on Settlement.

Looking back now, I see the pattern clearly. St. Augustine follows the same path as older Spanish settlements throughout the Americas. Santo Domingo was established for the same reasons we came here: to claim territory, find wealth, spread Christianity, and expand Spain's empire. Like Santo Domingo, like Havana, like Mexico City. We all struggled through harsh conditions, disease, and conflict in our early years.

We all depended on indigenous peoples for survival at first, yet Spain sought to dominate them through systems like the encomienda. I've heard from sailors who've been to Hispaniola that the Taino people who once lived there in great numbers have nearly vanished. Destroyed by European diseases, forced labor, and violence. The same pattern happened in Cuba, in Puerto Rico, across the Caribbean islands. Now I fear the same fate awaits the Timucua here in La Florida.

What makes me sad is how little we learn from the humanity of those who were here first. The Timucua are not obstacles to overcome or resources to exploit. They are people with their own rich cultures, histories, and rights to this land. They had built lives here for countless generations before any European ship touched these shores. Yet we treat them as if they existed only to serve Spain's ambitions.

Father once told me that history is written by those who build the strongest settlements and win the most battles. But I wonder: what will history say about us? Will it remember the bravery of exploration and the building of new settlements, or the tragedy of conquest and the destruction of entire peoples? Will it honor the Timucua voices, or silence them beneath the weight of Spanish ambition. Just as the Taino voices have been silenced in the islands to the south?

These are the questions I carry with me as I grow into manhood in this New World. Questions that have no easy answers, but must be asked nonetheless. I am part of Spain's great colonial enterprise, yet I cannot help but wonder if we are building our empire on foundations of injustice that will haunt us for generations to come.
