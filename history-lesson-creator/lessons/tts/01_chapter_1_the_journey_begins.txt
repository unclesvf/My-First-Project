Chapter One. The Journey Begins.

My name is Mateo, and I am thirteen years old. Today marks my first full year in this strange new land called La Florida. I still remember the smell of the salt air as our ship approached the coast, the way my stomach churned. Not from seasickness, but from fear and excitement twisted together like rope.

Father told me we were coming to build a new life, to claim land for Spain and spread our faith. The King himself had sent us, led by Don Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, to establish a settlement and drive out the French who dared to settle in Spanish territory.

When we first landed, the heat was unlike anything I'd known in Seville. The air was thick and heavy, and strange birds called from trees I'd never seen before. The indigenous Timucua people watched us from the forest edge. Curious, cautious, but not yet hostile.

We called our settlement St. Augustine, and immediately set to work building wooden fortifications. Every day, I helped carry timber and dig trenches. My hands, once soft from my mother's gentle care, grew calloused and strong.
