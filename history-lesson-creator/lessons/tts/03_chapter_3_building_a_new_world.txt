Chapter Three. Building a New World.

As seasons passed, St. Augustine grew from a desperate outpost into something resembling a town. We built a wooden chapel where Father Alonso held mass each Sunday. Stone replaced wood in our most important buildings, making them strong against both storms and attack.

Supplies arrived from Havana every few months. Tools, seeds, fabric, and news from Spain. Each ship brought new settlers: farmers, craftsmen, soldiers, and priests. The settlement expanded, pushing deeper into the wilderness.

The Spanish Crown wanted us to convert the indigenous people to Christianity and make them subjects of King Philip the Second. Some missionaries succeeded in baptizing Timucua families, but others resisted, clinging to their old ways and gods.

I often wondered what Ahone thought about all this. His world changing so rapidly, his people's land filling with strangers who spoke of a distant king and demanded obedience. When I asked him once, he simply said, "The world has always been changing, Mateo. The question is whether we change with it or are swept away."
