Chapter Four. Two Worlds Collide.

By my second year in St. Augustine, I understood that we were not just building a settlement. We were building an empire. Spain claimed this land, and settlements like ours were the foundation of that claim.

Father explained to me how our settlement fit into Spain's vast colonial empire. "We are not alone in this endeavor, Mateo," he said one evening. "To the south, our countrymen have built great cities. Santo Domingo on Hispaniola was founded seventy years ago and now has a university, a cathedral, and thousands of Spanish settlers. Havana in Cuba is nearly fifty years old and serves as the key to the Caribbean. From Mexico City to Lima in Peru, Spanish settlements are transforming these lands."

He told me that St. Augustine was Spain's answer to threats from France and other European powers. "The French tried to establish Fort Caroline just north of here last year, but we drove them out. Now we must prove that La Florida can be held, civilized, and made profitable for the Crown. We are the northern frontier of New Spain, the guardians of the treasure fleets that sail past our coast carrying silver from Peru and Mexico back to Spain."

I realized then that this "New World" was not new at all. It was ancient, with people who had lived here for generations beyond counting. What was new was us: the Spanish bringing Christianity, Spanish law, and European ways to lands that had their own rich cultures long before we arrived. The Timucua had thrived here for countless generations, yet we treated them as if they had been waiting for us to bring them civilization.

Yet here I am, part of this great expansion. My children will be born in this land, speaking Spanish but living lives my grandparents in Seville could never imagine. We are creating something new from the meeting of old worlds. Though at what cost, I'm still not sure.
