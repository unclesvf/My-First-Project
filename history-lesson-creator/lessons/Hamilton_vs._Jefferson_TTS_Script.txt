Welcome to today's history lesson. Hamilton vs. Jefferson. Federalists vs. Democratic-Republicans (1790s).

You will hear this story from Samuel, age fifteen, son of a Virginia farmer, seventeen ninety-six.

Chapter One. Two Visions.

I'm Samuel, fifteen, and I'm learning that America has two completely different visions for its future. Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson can't agree on anything, and their disagreements are splitting the nation.

Hamilton wants America to become like Britain: urban, industrial, commercial. He supports a strong federal government, a national bank, tariffs to protect manufacturers, and close ties with Britain. He believes the wealthy and educated should lead society. He trusts central power.

Jefferson wants America to remain a nation of independent farmers. He supports strong state governments, strict limits on federal power, no national bank, and friendship with France. He believes ordinary people can govern themselves. He fears centralized power leads to tyranny.

These aren't just policy disagreements, they're fundamental disagreements about what America should be. And they're creating the first political parties, something the Founders hoped to avoid.

Chapter Two. Political Parties Form.

Hamilton's supporters call themselves Federalists. They're mostly merchants, bankers, manufacturers, and wealthy landowners from cities and northern states. They want a strong, active federal government.

Jefferson's supporters call themselves Democratic-Republicans (or just Republicans, not related to today's Republican Party). They're mostly farmers, planters, and working people from the South and West. They want limited federal government and strong states' rights.

The two parties fight viciously. Federalist newspapers call Jefferson an anarchist who'll destroy order. Democratic-Republican papers call Hamilton a monarchist who wants to crown himself king. The attacks get personal and nasty.

Father supports Jefferson, we're Virginia farmers who value independence and fear distant government power. But our neighbor supports Hamilton, believing strong central government is necessary. Their friendship has become strained. Politics is dividing communities, even families.

Chapter Three. The Newspaper Wars.

The party battle plays out in newspapers. Hamilton secretly funds the Gazette of the United States, edited by John Fenno, which publishes Federalist views. Jefferson supports the National Gazette, edited by Philip Freneau, which attacks Federalist policies.

The papers don't just disagree, they attack viciously. The Gazette of the United States claims Jefferson wants mob rule and chaos. The National Gazette accuses Hamilton of wanting to establish a monarchy and destroy republican government. They question each other's motives, integrity, and patriotism.

I read both papers at our general store, watching neighbors argue over the articles. One Federalist paper claimed Jefferson was a dangerous radical influenced by the bloody French Revolution. A Democratic-Republican paper responded that Hamilton wanted to create an American aristocracy and turn workers into wage slaves.

Father shakes his head at the vitriol. "Washington warned against political parties," he says. "Now look at us, we're tearing ourselves apart." But he still reads the Democratic-Republican papers and nods along with their attacks on Hamilton. Nobody seems immune to the partisan fever.

Chapter Four. Foreign Policy Divides Us.

The French Revolution makes our divisions worse. In 1789, France overthrew its monarchy, claiming to follow America's example. Jefferson and his supporters celebrate, France is becoming a republic! But when the revolution turns violent with mass executions and radical policies, Federalists are horrified.

Then France and Britain go to war in 1793. We have a treaty with France from the Revolution, should we help them? Jefferson thinks we have an obligation. Hamilton says the treaty was with the French monarchy, which no longer exists, and besides, we're too weak to fight Britain.

Washington declares neutrality, making both sides angry. Democratic-Republicans accuse him of abandoning our French allies who helped us win independence. Federalists say he's being too cautious about offending France.

When Washington sends John Jay to negotiate a treaty with Britain, Democratic-Republicans are furious. The Jay Treaty settles some disputes with Britain but gives them favorable trade terms. Father and his friends burn John Jay in effigy in our town square. "We're crawling back to Britain!" they shout. "We're betraying France and the principles of liberty!"

I'm learning that foreign policy isn't just about other countries, it's about our identity. Federalists see Britain as a model: orderly, prosperous, stable. Democratic-Republicans see France: revolutionary, democratic, fighting against monarchy and aristocracy. Our foreign friendships reflect which America we want to be.

Chapter Five. The Election of 1796.

When Washington retires, the first true partisan presidential election happens in 1796. Federalist John Adams runs against Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson. There are no national campaigns, the candidates don't travel or give speeches. But their supporters wage vicious newspaper wars.

Federalist papers say Jefferson is an atheist who'll destroy religion, a radical who'll bring French-style chaos and bloodshed to America. They claim he's weak on defense and will leave us vulnerable to foreign threats.

Democratic-Republican papers say Adams wants to be king, that he'll crush liberty and create an aristocracy. They accuse Federalists of favoring the wealthy over ordinary people, Britain over America's true interests.

Adams wins narrowly, and under the old system where the second-place finisher becomes vice president, Jefferson becomes Adams's VP. Imagine, the president and vice president from opposing parties, who despise each other's vision for America!

Father is disappointed but not defeated. "We'll win next time," he says. "More and more people are seeing that Federalists serve the rich, not the people." Our neighbor, a Federalist, warns that Democratic-Republicans will ruin the country with mob rule. Neither side can imagine the other might have valid points.

Chapter Six. What Political Parties Mean.

The Founders hoped we wouldn't have political parties. Washington warned against them in his Farewell Address. They feared parties would put faction above country, loyalty to party above loyalty to nation.

But parties emerged anyway because Americans genuinely disagree about fundamental questions: Should the federal government be strong or limited? Should America be agricultural or industrial? Should we favor Britain or France? Should power rest with educated elites or ordinary people?

At our general store, I watch these debates play out. My Federalist neighbor, Mister Peterson, genuinely believes strong central government is necessary to keep order and prosperity. Father genuinely believes centralized power leads to tyranny. Both love America, they just see completely different paths to its success.

The newspaper attacks trouble me. Each side portrays the other as evil, un-American, dangerous. But I know both Mister Peterson and Father. They're good, honest men who disagree. Can both be right? Can both be wrong?

Mother has a different perspective. "Men always think their disagreements are unique and important," she says. "But parties might actually help. At least now people know where candidates stand. Before parties, everything was personalities and connections. Now we debate ideas and visions."

Maybe she's right. Political parties organize people who share views. They offer voters clear choices. They hold leaders accountable to their supporters. Yes, they attack each other viciously. Yes, they put party before country sometimes. But they also give regular people like Father a way to participate in government, to feel like their voice matters.

Watching Federalists and Democratic-Republicans battle, I realize we're creating something new: a system where peaceful political competition replaces violent revolution. We can disagree intensely without killing each other. We can vote out leaders we dislike without military coups. The newspapers may be vicious, but it's ink, not blood. That's something, I suppose. That's American.

This concludes today's lesson. Hamilton vs. Jefferson. Thank you for listening.
