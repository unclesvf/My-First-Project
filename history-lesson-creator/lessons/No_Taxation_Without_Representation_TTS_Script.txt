Welcome to today's history lesson. No Taxation Without Representation. The Stamp Act Crisis (1765).

You will hear this story from William, age sixteen, apprentice to a Boston printer, seventeen sixty-five.

Chapter One. The Stamp Act.

My name is William, and I am sixteen years old. I'm an apprentice at a printing shop in Boston, learning the trade from Master Green. Today, March 22, 1765, news arrived that has everyone in our shop furious: Parliament has passed the Stamp Act.

This law requires colonists to buy special stamped paper for all printed materials, newspapers, legal documents, licenses, even playing cards. Every document must bear a tax stamp purchased from British officials. The money will pay for British troops stationed in America.

Master Green is livid. "This will destroy our business!" he says. We'll have to buy expensive stamped paper for every newspaper, pamphlet, and broadside we print. The cost will drive customers away. But it's not just about money, it's about principle.

"We are British subjects," Master Green declares. "We have the right to be taxed only by our own representatives. We have no representatives in Parliament. Therefore, Parliament has no right to tax us directly. This is tyranny!" His words echo what I'm hearing in taverns, on street corners, everywhere. The cry goes up: "No taxation without representation!"

Chapter Two. Sons of Liberty.

A group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty has formed to resist the Stamp Act. They meet at night, make plans, and intimidate anyone who supports the tax. Their leader is Samuel Adams, a firebrand who writes passionate articles against British tyranny.

I watched yesterday as a mob gathered around the house of Andrew Oliver, the man appointed to distribute stamps in Massachusetts. They hung an effigy of him from a tree, then burned it. They destroyed a building he owned and damaged his house. Oliver resigned the next day, refusing to distribute the stamps.

The crowds frightened me, there's something dangerous about mob violence, even when directed at unjust laws. But I also feel the excitement. We're standing up for our rights. We're refusing to submit to taxation without consent.

Similar protests are erupting throughout the colonies. In New York, stamp distributors resign. In Virginia, Patrick Henry delivers a fiery speech declaring "If this be treason, make the most of it!" The colonies are uniting in resistance, connected by shared outrage at this violation of their rights.

Chapter Three. Colonial Unity.

In October, representatives from nine colonies met in New York for a Stamp Act Congress. This is remarkable, the colonies rarely cooperate. But this threat has brought us together. The Congress declared that only colonial assemblies, not Parliament, have the right to tax colonists.

Meanwhile, merchants organized boycotts of British goods. "Non-importation agreements," they call them. Women formed spinning groups to make homemade cloth instead of buying British textiles. Even ordinary people like me are part of this resistance by choosing what we buy.

The boycotts hurt British merchants, who pressured Parliament to repeal the Stamp Act. In March 1766, Parliament repealed it! Church bells rang, celebrations erupted in the streets. We won! Our unity and resistance forced Britain to back down.

But there's a darker side to this victory. Parliament also passed the Declaratory Act, asserting their right to legislate for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever." They may have repealed this tax, but they claim absolute authority over us. The fundamental conflict hasn't been resolved, it's only been postponed.

Chapter Four. The Townshend Acts.

Our celebration didn't last long. In 1767, Parliament passed new taxes called the Townshend Acts, named for Charles Townshend, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. These taxes are different from the Stamp Act, they're duties on imported goods like tea, glass, lead, paint, and paper.

Parliament thinks they're being clever. They claim these aren't "internal" taxes like the Stamp Act, but "external" taxes on trade, something they've always regulated. But we see through this distinction. A tax is a tax, and we still have no representation in Parliament.

The revenue from these taxes will pay the salaries of royal governors and judges in America. Master Green explains why this is dangerous: "If Britain pays our governors, they'll serve British interests, not ours. Our governors will no longer depend on colonial assemblies for their salaries, so they won't have to listen to us."

The acts also allow British customs officials to use "writs of assistance", general search warrants that let them search any building for smuggled goods without specific cause. It feels like our rights as Englishmen are being stripped away, one by one. We renewed our boycotts, and once again, the streets filled with tension.

Chapter Five. The Power of Resistance.

These years have taught me something profound: ordinary people have power when they stand together. I'm just a printer's apprentice, but when I refuse to buy British tea, when Master Green prints pamphlets explaining our rights, when my neighbors boycott imported goods, we're all part of something larger.

Women have become crucial to this resistance. They're called the "Daughters of Liberty," and they organize spinning bees to produce homemade cloth. They serve coffee instead of tea. They teach their children about liberty and rights. My mother says she feels like she's part of history, not just watching it happen.

The colonial assemblies have grown bolder too. The Massachusetts Assembly circulated a letter to other colonies urging united resistance. Britain ordered them to rescind it. They refused. Britain dissolved the assembly, but that only made more people angry. You can't suppress ideas by silencing the people who speak them, the ideas just spread wider.

I've learned that we're not just fighting about taxes. We're fighting about what it means to have rights. Are we British subjects with the rights of Englishmen? Or are we second-class colonials who must submit to whatever Parliament decides? The answer to that question will shape our future, and Britain's too.

This concludes today's lesson. No Taxation Without Representation. Thank you for listening.
