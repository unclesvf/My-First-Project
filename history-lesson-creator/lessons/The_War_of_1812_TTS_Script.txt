Welcome to today's history lesson. The War of 1812. Second War for Independence (1812-1815).

You will hear this story from Daniel, age sixteen, militiaman from Baltimore, eighteen fourteen.

Chapter One. Going to War Again.

I'm Daniel, sixteen, and we're at war with Britain again. The reasons are complicated: Britain's been stopping our ships, searching them, and forcing American sailors to serve in the British navy, "impressment," they call it. Britain aids Native tribes fighting American expansion. Americans want to seize Canada. "War Hawks" in Congress pushed for war despite our weak military.

The war isn't going well. We tried to invade Canada and failed. Britain's navy blockades our coast. Our economy suffers. Many Federalists oppose the war, especially in New England where merchants lose money. Some even talk of secession, leaving the Union!

In August 1814, British troops invaded Washington D.C., burning the Capitol and White House. President Madison fled. It was humiliating. Now British ships are attacking Baltimore, where I live. We're determined to defend Fort McHenry in our harbor.

Chapter Two. The Star-Spangled Banner.

All night on September 13-14, 1814, British ships bombarded Fort McHenry. I watched from the city as "rockets' red glare" and "bombs bursting in air" lit up the darkness. Would the fort surrender? Could it hold?

At dawn, through the smoke, we saw it: our flag still flew over the fort! We'd held. The British gave up the attack. We'd defended our city!

A lawyer named Francis Scott Key watched the battle from a ship. So moved by the flag's survival, he wrote a poem: "The Star-Spangled Banner." It captured our determination, battered but unbowed, our flag still waved. His poem became our national anthem.

The war ended with the Treaty of Ghent in December 1814. Nothing really changed, no territory exchanged, no major concessions. But we'd stood up to Britain again. We'd defended our sovereignty. This "Second War for Independence" proved America would survive.

Chapter Three. The Burning of Washington.

August 1814 brought America's darkest moment in the war. A British force marched on Washington D.C., our nation's capital. Our militia tried to stop them at Bladensburg, Maryland, but we broke and ran, soldiers call it the "Bladensburg Races."

British troops entered Washington unopposed. They burned the Capitol building, where Congress meets. They burned the White House, forcing President and Dolley Madison to flee. Dolley saved important documents and a portrait of George Washington before escaping. The British burned the Treasury, War Department, and other government buildings.

My uncle was there. He described the horror: "The British took revenge for our burning of York in Canada. They methodically destroyed our government buildings. But they spared private homes and didn't loot. It was military destruction, not mob violence. Still, seeing our capital burn while our government fled was humiliating beyond words."

The burning of Washington shocked Americans. How could we let the enemy reach our capital? Where was our army? Some newspapers called for Madison's resignation. Federalists said the war was foolish from the start. But most Americans felt anger and determination, we would not surrender.

The British expected the burning to break American will. Instead, it strengthened our resolve. When they moved on Baltimore, they found us ready to fight. We wouldn't let them burn another city. The humiliation of Washington turned into the determination that saved Fort McHenry.

Chapter Four. The Hartford Convention.

Three months after we defended Baltimore, in December 1814, New England Federalists met in Hartford, Connecticut. They opposed the war from the beginning, it hurt their shipping trade with Britain. Some talked openly of New England leaving the Union.

The Hartford Convention proposed constitutional amendments to limit federal power: require two-thirds vote to declare war, admit new states, or restrict trade. They wanted to protect New England's interests against the South and West. Some delegates whispered about secession if their demands weren't met.

Father was furious. "The country's at war, and they're threatening to break apart? That's treason!" He saw the Convention as selfish New England merchants putting profits above patriotism.

But the Convention's timing proved disastrous. As they debated, news arrived: we'd defended Baltimore, defeated the British at Plattsburgh, New York, and, most incredibly, Andrew Jackson had crushed a British invasion at New Orleans! The war was ending in American victories.

Then came news of the Treaty of Ghent, peace! The Hartford Convention suddenly looked foolish and unpatriotic. They'd threatened secession just as America was winning. The Federalist Party never recovered. They appeared to be traitors who'd opposed a successful war. Within a few years, the Federalist Party died.

Chapter Five. The Battle of New Orleans.

The war's strangest moment came in January 1815. Andrew Jackson, commanding American forces in New Orleans, faced a battle British army. On January 8, British troops in neat formations charged American positions behind cotton bales and earthworks.

It was a slaughter. American rifles and cannons cut down wave after wave of British soldiers. In 30 minutes, over 2,000 British were killed or wounded, including their commanding general. American casualties were fewer than 100. It was one of the most lopsided victories in military history.

Jackson became a national hero. The victory proved Americans could defeat British regulars in open battle. It erased the shame of earlier defeats and the burning of Washington. Americans celebrated wildly, we'd beaten Britain!

But there was a terrible irony: the battle was fought two weeks after the Treaty of Ghent ended the war. News traveled so slowly that neither side knew peace had been signed. Over 2,000 men died in a battle that didn't need to happen, fighting for a war that was already over.

The Battle of New Orleans didn't change the war's outcome, the treaty was already signed. But it changed American psychology. We'd ended the war with a spectacular victory, not a whimper. Andrew Jackson became a symbol of American toughness. The West had saved the nation where the East had failed. These shifts would reshape American politics for decades.

Chapter Six. What the War Meant.

The War of 1812 ended where it began, no territory changed hands, no major concessions made. Historians sometimes call it a pointless war, achieving nothing at the cost of thousands of lives. But it changed America in profound ways.

First, it proved America's survival. We'd fought the world's most powerful empire to a draw. Britain would never again treat us as a minor nuisance. We'd earned respect as an independent nation.

Second, it killed the Federalist Party. Their opposition to the war, especially the Hartford Convention, destroyed them politically. The "Era of Good Feelings" followed, with Democratic-Republicans dominating and partisan divisions seemingly vanishing (though they'd return).

Third, it sparked American nationalism. Before 1812, many Americans identified primarily with their state, "I'm a Virginian" before "I'm an American." The war created shared national experiences and heroes. Francis Scott Key's anthem gave us a national song. Andrew Jackson gave us a national myth of frontier toughness defeating European aristocracy.

Fourth, it shifted attention westward. The East hadn't covered itself in glory, Washington burned, invasions of Canada failed. But the West produced Jackson's victory and a spirit of can-do determination. Political power would increasingly shift west.

Finally, it convinced Americans that we could stand alone, without European alliances. We'd fought Britain, the superpower, without France's help this time. This reinforced our sense that America was different, special, capable of going its own way.

Standing in Baltimore, looking at the flag over Fort McHenry, I understand what Key meant when he wrote our anthem. The flag is more than cloth, it's a symbol that we'll endure. We've been bombarded, invaded, our capital burned. But we're still here, still free, still independent. That flag still waves. And as long as it does, America survives.

This concludes today's lesson. The War of 1812. Thank you for listening.
