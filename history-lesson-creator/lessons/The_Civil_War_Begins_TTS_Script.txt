Welcome to today's history lesson. The Civil War Begins. Bull Run to Antietam (1861-1862).

You will hear this story from Thomas, age seventeen, Union soldier, eighteen sixty-two.

Chapter One. First Bull Run—The Illusion Shatters.

I'm Thomas, seventeen years old, and I enlisted in the Union Army in May 1861. The war fever in my hometown of Cleveland was intense. After Fort Sumter fell, President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers. Within days, thousands of men signed up, including me.

We were confident, cocky, even. We'd heard Southerners were inferior fighters, plantation aristocrats who'd never done hard work. We'd crush this rebellion in three months, march to Richmond, capture Jeff Davis, and be home by harvest. Our officers encouraged this thinking. "One good battle," they said, "and the Confederacy will collapse."

In July, we marched from Washington toward Manassas, Virginia, where Confederate forces gathered near a creek called Bull Run. It was slow going. Our regiment of volunteers had barely trained. We weren't soldiers yet, just farmers and clerks in uniforms.

The march felt like a picnic. Civilians from Washington followed in carriages, bringing picnic baskets and opera glasses to watch the battle. Congressmen came. Society ladies. They expected entertainment, a real battle to witness from a safe distance.

July 21, 1861. The battle began at dawn. At first, it went well. We pushed Confederate forces back. By afternoon, we seemed to be winning. Then everything fell apart.

Confederate reinforcements arrived, fresh troops led by General Thomas Jackson. Our forces attacked his position repeatedly. He wouldn't budge. "There stands Jackson like a stone wall!" a Confederate officer shouted. The name stuck, Stonewall Jackson.

More Confederate reinforcements arrived. They counterattacked. Our line broke. Someone shouted "Retreat!" and suddenly we were running. The retreat became a rout, panicked soldiers fleeing in disorder. Civilians who'd come to watch got caught in the chaos. Carriages overturned. Men abandoned weapons and equipment.

I ran too. I'm not proud of it, but when thousands of men are running and artillery shells are exploding, you run. We didn't stop until we reached Washington, exhausted and humiliated.

The battle taught us the war wouldn't be quick or easy. The Confederates were fighters. This would be a long, hard war.

Chapter Two. Building an Army.

After Bull Run, the Union Army transformed. General George McClellan took command. He was young, energetic, and organized. "I will build the finest army the world has seen," he promised.

McClellan was good at training. He drilled us constantly. We learned to march in formation, load and fire rifles properly, dig entrenchments, follow orders. He built hospitals, supply systems, and fortifications around Washington. Raw recruits became soldiers.

But McClellan was overcautious. He always believed Confederate forces were larger than they were. He drilled us for months, preparing for a perfect campaign. Lincoln grew impatient. "If McClellan isn't going to use his army, I'd like to borrow it," Lincoln reportedly said.

Meanwhile, I was learning what war really meant. The camps were crowded, unsanitary, and disease-ridden. For every soldier killed in battle, two died from disease, typhoid, dysentery, measles. My friend William died of typhoid in camp, never firing a shot at the enemy.

Letters from home told of growing war weariness. People were shocked by casualty lists. The romance of war faded when fathers and sons started dying. But Lincoln insisted we must preserve the Union. The nation couldn't survive if states could leave whenever they disagreed with election results.

The war's purpose evolved too. At first, we fought to preserve the Union, explicitly not to free slaves. Lincoln feared alienating border states like Kentucky and Maryland if he made it about slavery. But as the war continued and we saw enslaved people fleeing to Union lines, asking for protection, the slavery question became unavoidable.

Some escaped slaves helped the Union cause, providing intelligence about Confederate positions, working as laborers, even guiding our troops. "Contraband," we called them, Confederate property now in Union hands. It was a legal fiction that avoided calling them free, but it recognized we couldn't send them back to slavery while fighting against their masters.

By early 1862, we were ready for a real campaign. McClellan planned to take Richmond by landing troops on the Virginia peninsula and advancing up toward the capital. The Peninsula Campaign would test whether we were truly ready for war.

Chapter Three. The Peninsula Campaign—Frustration.

Spring 1862. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign began with promise and ended in frustration. We landed over 100,000 troops on the peninsula between the York and James Rivers, planning to march up to Richmond, just 70 miles away.

But McClellan moved cautiously, always overestimating Confederate strength. He spent weeks besieging Yorktown, though it was lightly defended. When Confederates abandoned it, we pursued slowly. Confederate forces under General Joseph Johnston retreated toward Richmond, and McClellan followed at a crawl.

By late May, we could see Richmond's church spires. We were so close! Then Johnston attacked at Seven Pines. The battle was chaotic and bloody but inconclusive. Johnston was wounded, though, and Jefferson Davis replaced him with Robert E. Lee.

That change would prove significant. Lee was aggressive where Johnston had been cautious. Within weeks, Lee launched the Seven Days Battles, a series of attacks that drove us away from Richmond. We lost more men than Lee did, but McClellan panicked and retreated to the James River.

I was in those battles. The fighting was more intense than Bull Run. At Gaines' Mill, Confederate forces attacked our position repeatedly. The noise was deafening, thousands of rifles firing, artillery booming, men screaming. We held our position for hours before being ordered to retreat.

At Malvern Hill, the final battle of the Seven Days, we repulsed massive Confederate attacks. They charged across open ground into our artillery fire, slaughter worse than anything I'd seen. We won tactically but retreated anyway because McClellan lost his nerve.

The Peninsula Campaign failed. McClellan blamed Washington for not sending reinforcements. Lincoln blamed McClellan for being overcautious. We'd gotten within sight of Richmond but accomplished nothing except losing thousands of men.

The campaign taught me that generals matter. McClellan was brilliant at organization but terrible at fighting. Lee was the opposite, aggressive, willing to take risks. Unless we found better generals, this war would last years.

Chapter Four. Second Bull Run—Defeat Again.

After McClellan's Peninsula Campaign failed, Lincoln tried a new approach. He brought General John Pope from the West to command a new Army of Virginia. Pope was confident, even arrogant. "I have come to you from the West, where we have always seen the backs of our enemies," he announced.

August 1862. Lee and Stonewall Jackson outmaneuvered Pope at Second Bull Run, the same battlefield where we'd been defeated a year earlier. Jackson marched his forces around Pope's flank, attacked our supply depot, then positioned his troops along an unfinished railroad cut.

Pope attacked Jackson's position repeatedly, thinking he'd trapped Jackson. But Lee arrived with reinforcements. On the second day, while Pope focused on Jackson, Lee's other corps under James Longstreet hit our flank with 28,000 men. Our line collapsed. We retreated again to Washington, defeated at the same place we'd been beaten a year earlier.

I fought in those attacks against Jackson's position. We charged across open ground into rifle and artillery fire. Men fell by the hundreds. We'd reach the railroad cut, fight hand-to-hand, then be driven back. We attacked again and again, making no progress, losing friends with each assault.

When Longstreet's attack hit our flank, the retreat became a rout again. We fell back to Washington's fortifications, exhausted and demoralized. Pope was relieved of command. Lincoln, despite misgivings, restored McClellan to command. McClellan was cautious, but soldiers trusted him.

Then Lee made a bold move: he invaded Maryland. If he could win a victory on Northern soil, Britain and France might recognize the Confederacy. Maryland, a slave state, might join the Confederacy. A victory might swing the fall elections to Democrats who'd negotiate peace.

McClellan marched out to meet Lee. We were tired, depleted, and demoralized from defeats. But we were also angry. The Confederates had invaded our territory. This time we'd be defending our homes, not attacking theirs. The armies converged on a small Maryland town: Sharpsburg, along Antietam Creek.

Chapter Five. Antietam—The Bloodiest Day.

September 17, 1862. Antietam. The bloodiest single day in American history. Twenty-three thousand men killed, wounded, or missing in twelve hours of fighting.

I was in the assault on the Sunken Road, later called Bloody Lane. Confederate infantry positioned in a natural trench fired volley after volley into our ranks as we advanced across an open field. Men fell in waves. We'd get close, fire, retreat, then attack again. For three hours we assaulted that position, bodies piling up. Finally, we flanked it and the Confederates retreated, leaving the sunken road filled with their dead and wounded.

Meanwhile, other battles raged. At the Cornfield, men fought back and forth through tall corn. The field changed hands multiple times. "Every stalk of corn was cut down as if by a knife," a soldier said later. At the Dunker Church, infantry and artillery tore the small building apart. At Burnside's Bridge, Union forces spent hours trying to cross a narrow stone bridge under Confederate fire.

The fighting was worse than anything I'd experienced. At Gaines' Mill or Second Bull Run, the battle was chaotic but spread across time and space. At Antietam, it was concentrated horror, thousands of men in a small area killing each other with rifles, artillery, and bayonets.

By evening, both armies were exhausted. Technically the battle was a draw, neither side clearly won. But Lee's invasion was stopped. He retreated back to Virginia, his Maryland Campaign failed. McClellan claimed victory but didn't pursue aggressively, frustrating Lincoln again.

But Antietam had enormous consequences beyond the battlefield. Lincoln had been waiting for a Union victory to announce a new policy. On September 22, five days after Antietam, he issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. On January 1, 1863, all slaves in states still in rebellion would be declared free.

The war's purpose transformed. We weren't just fighting to preserve the Union, we were fighting to end slavery. It changed everything. Britain and France, which had considered recognizing the Confederacy, couldn't support a nation fighting to preserve slavery. Enslaved people in the South began escaping to Union lines, seeking the freedom Lincoln promised. And Northern soldiers like me now fought for a moral cause, not just a political one.

Looking back, Antietam was the turning point. Not militarily, the war would continue nearly three more years. But morally and politically. After Antietam, the war became a war to end slavery. And that meant there could be no compromise, no negotiated peace that left the institution intact. The war would end only with Union victory and slavery's destruction. The bloodiest day led to the most important transformation, from a war to preserve the Union to a war for freedom.

This concludes today's lesson. The Civil War Begins. Thank you for listening.
