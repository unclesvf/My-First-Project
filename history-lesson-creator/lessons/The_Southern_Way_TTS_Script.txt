Welcome to today's history lesson. The Southern Way. Southern Colonies and the Growth of Slavery (1660-1700).

You will hear this story from Thomas, age fourteen, son of a small tobacco farmer in Virginia, sixteen ninety.

Chapter One. Life on a Small Farm.

My name is Thomas, and I am fourteen years old. My family owns a small tobacco farm in Virginia. We're not wealthy planters with hundreds of acres, we have just fifty acres and grow enough tobacco to make a modest living.

Unlike the huge plantations, we don't own enslaved workers. Father, my older brother William, and I do all the work ourselves. We plant in spring, tend the plants all summer, and harvest in fall. It's backbreaking work under the hot Virginia sun. Mother and my sister help with curing the tobacco leaves and running the household.

Most families in Virginia are like us, small farmers, not wealthy planters. But the big planters have the most power. They own thousands of acres and use enslaved African laborers to work their fields. These plantations produce most of Virginia's tobacco and make their owners very rich.

Father says the colony is changing. When he was young, most workers were indentured servants like in Jamestown. They worked for several years and then were free. But now, more and more planters are buying enslaved Africans who will never be free, nor will their children.

Chapter Two. The Growth of Slavery.

Our neighbor, Mister Randolph, is a wealthy planter. He owns a plantation with two hundred acres and twenty enslaved workers. I've seen them working in his fields from dawn to dusk, supervised by an overseer with a whip. The enslaved people live in small wooden cabins and grow their own food in small gardens.

Last month, a ship arrived from Africa with eighty enslaved people. Mister Randolph bought three of them, two men and a woman. They looked terrified and exhausted. They didn't speak English and were separated from their families. Watching them, I felt sick to my stomach. Father saw my face and said quietly, "This is wrong, Thomas. But it's becoming the foundation of our colony's economy."

The laws are changing to make slavery permanent and hereditary. A new law says that children born to enslaved mothers will also be enslaved for life, no matter who the father is. Another law forbids enslaved people from carrying weapons, gathering in groups, or learning to read. These laws treat human beings as property, not people.

I asked Father why we don't speak out against slavery. He said quietly that those who do are shunned, lose business, and are called troublemakers. "The people who profit from slavery have all the power, Thomas. They make the laws in the House of Burgesses. They've convinced themselves it's acceptable because enslaved people are different from us. But that's a lie we tell ourselves to justify evil."

Chapter Three. Different Souths.

The Southern colonies are different from each other. Virginia and Maryland grow tobacco. South Carolina grows rice in coastal swamps where the work is brutal and deadly. The rice fields must be flooded and drained, and workers labor in water up to their knees, plagued by mosquitoes and disease. The Carolinas have more enslaved workers than free people in some areas.

All Southern colonies have plantation economies, warm climates, and long growing seasons. The soil and climate are perfect for cash crops that sell for high prices in England: tobacco, rice, and later cotton. But these crops require intense labor, which is why planters turned to slavery.

The plantation system creates a rigid social structure. At the top are wealthy planters who own huge estates and enslaved workers. They control the government and make the laws. Below them are small farmers like my family. At the bottom are poor white workers and indentured servants. And below even them, treated not as people but as property, are the enslaved Africans.

This is different from New England, where most people are small farmers or merchants, or the Middle Colonies, where religious diversity and trade dominate. The South is building its wealth on slavery, and this choice will have terrible consequences that will echo for centuries.

Chapter Four. Understanding the System.

I've been thinking a lot about what Father said. How did we get here? How did English colonists who came seeking freedom create a system that denies freedom to others?

Father explained that it started gradually. First, colonists used indentured servants. But servants eventually went free and wanted their own land. Then some planters tried enslaving Native Americans, but they could escape into familiar territory. African people, forcibly brought across the ocean, couldn't escape home.

Slavery became more profitable as tobacco cultivation grew. Planters convinced themselves that enslaved Africans were inferior, that slavery was somehow natural or even beneficial. They created laws making slavery hereditary and permanent. They built an entire economy on this cruel foundation.

But Father reminds me that slavery is a choice, not inevitable. The Northern colonies are moving away from slavery. Pennsylvania Quakers speak against it. Even some Southern colonists know it's wrong. "What we build now," Father says, "will shape what America becomes. And I fear we're building on sand and blood."

I'm only fourteen, but I understand that I'm witnessing something terrible, the creation of a system that will divide our nation. I wonder if future generations will judge us harshly for what we allowed to happen, for what we didn't stop when we could have.

Chapter Five. Resistance and Humanity.

Last week, three enslaved people escaped from Randolph's plantation. They disappeared into the forest, heading north. Randolph hired slave catchers with dogs to track them. Two were caught and whipped publicly as a warning. The third, a young man named Samuel, was never found. I hope he made it to freedom.

I've seen small acts of resistance everywhere once I started looking. Enslaved workers slow their pace when overseers aren't watching. They break tools "accidentally." They sing songs with hidden meanings about freedom and deliverance. One woman Father knows keeps a small garden where she grows African plants from seeds she somehow preserved across the ocean. These small acts preserve their humanity against a system designed to deny it.

At church, our minister preaches that slavery is God's will, quoting Bible passages about servants obeying masters. But Father showed me other passages about treating others as you'd want to be treated, about freedom and justice. "The Bible can be twisted to justify anything," he said. "You have to choose what kind of person you'll be."

Our family will never buy enslaved workers. We'll stay small farmers and do our own labor. It's not enough, we should speak out more boldly, but it's something. Father says every person must decide whether to participate in evil or resist it, even in small ways. I'm choosing resistance. Someday, I hope this terrible institution will end, though I fear it may take something catastrophic to uproot what we've planted so deeply.

This concludes today's lesson. The Southern Way. Thank you for listening.
