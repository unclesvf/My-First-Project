Welcome to today's history lesson. Survival in Jamestown. The Struggles of the First Permanent English Colony (1607-1620).

You will hear this story from Samuel, age fourteen, an indentured servant in Jamestown, sixteen oh nine.

Chapter One. Arrival in Virginia.

My name is Samuel, and I am fourteen years old. I came to Virginia as an indentured servant, bound to work for seven years in exchange for passage to this new land. The Virginia Company promised riches and opportunity, but what I found was something very different.

When our ship sailed up the James River in the spring of 1609, I saw a small fort surrounded by endless forests. About 200 colonists lived here, and they looked thin and weary. The gentlemen who led us wore fine clothes but knew nothing of farming or building. They expected to find gold like the Spanish had in Mexico.

Captain John Smith ran the colony with strict rules: "He who does not work, shall not eat." This angered many of the gentlemen who thought manual labor beneath them. But Smith knew we had to work together to survive, or we would all perish.

The fort's walls were made of logs, and inside stood a church, a storehouse, and crude houses. Beyond the walls lived the Powhatan people, led by their powerful chief. We depended on them for corn and knowledge of this strange land.

Chapter Two. The Starving Time.

The winter of 1609 brought horror beyond imagination. We called it the "Starving Time." Captain Smith had been injured and returned to England, leaving us without strong leadership. The Powhatans, tired of our demands for food, stopped trading with us and surrounded the fort.

We were trapped. We ate our horses first, then rats and mice. When those ran out, we boiled our leather boots and belts. People died every day, from hunger, from disease, from despair. Of the 500 colonists who started that winter, only 60 of us survived to see spring.

I survived by eating anything I could find. I dug for roots outside the fort walls at night, risking attack. I watched friends waste away, their eyes hollow and their bodies skeletal. We buried so many people that we ran out of space in the graveyard.

In June 1610, supply ships arrived. Lord De La Warr brought food, new colonists, and renewed hope. We had been ready to abandon Jamestown and return to England, but these supplies saved the colony. Still, the memory of that winter haunts me even now.

Chapter Three. Tobacco Saves the Colony.

A man named John Rolfe changed everything when he began growing tobacco. He experimented with seeds from the Caribbean, creating a variety that grew well in Virginia's soil and tasted sweet when smoked. The English couldn't get enough of it.

Suddenly, we had found our gold, not the metal kind, but green leaves that brought profit. Everyone wanted to grow tobacco. Fields replaced forests. Even the streets of Jamestown were plowed up to plant more. We shipped barrel after barrel to England, and money poured back.

But tobacco required intense labor. The work was backbreaking: planting, weeding, picking, curing. We indentured servants worked from sunrise to sunset. The Virginia Company brought more and more servants from England, poor people like me who traded years of their lives for a chance in America.

John Rolfe also married Pocahontas, daughter of Chief Powhatan. This marriage brought peace between us and the Powhatans, at least for a while. She took the Christian name Rebecca and even traveled to England, where she was treated like royalty. Her marriage showed that perhaps our two peoples could coexist.

Chapter Four. The First Representative Government.

In 1619, something remarkable happened. The Virginia Company allowed us to form the House of Burgesses, the first representative assembly in the American colonies. We could elect burgesses to make local laws, as long as they didn't contradict the company's rules or English law.

For the first time, colonists had a voice in their own government. We discussed matters like tobacco prices, land distribution, and relations with the Powhatans. It wasn't full democracy, only property-owning men could vote, but it was a start. This small seed of self-government would grow over time.

That same year, a Dutch ship arrived carrying about twenty Africans. They were sold as indentured servants, like me, expected to work for a set number of years and then be free. We didn't know it then, but this marked the beginning of something dark, the system of slavery that would eventually replace indentured servitude.

Now, as I near the end of my seven years of service, I look at Jamestown with mixed feelings. We survived the impossible. We created a permanent English colony in America. But at what cost? So many died. We took land from the Powhatans. And I fear the seeds of slavery we've planted will bear bitter fruit.

Chapter Five. Freedom's Promise and Price.

Today I am twenty-four years old. Three years ago I completed my seven years of indenture and became a free man. Master Thompson gave me my freedom dues: fifty acres of land, tools, seed corn, and two sets of clothes. I own nothing else, but I own myself, and that means everything.

In these three years since my freedom, I've built a small cabin on my land, about ten miles upriver from Jamestown. The soil is good for tobacco, and through hard work, I've begun to prosper. Some former servants have become successful planters themselves, even serving in our new House of Burgesses, which was established just this year. In Virginia, a man can rise through his own labor, a chance I'd never have had in England.

Yet I see troubling changes. This year, a ship brought about twenty Africans to our shores. They were sold as workers, and I fear planters will increasingly prefer enslaved laborers over indentured servants like I once was. Unlike me, these Africans may never earn their freedom. Already, I see planters treating African workers differently than they treated English servants. I fear that in time, this bondage will become permanent and hereditary, creating a society built on injustice that can never be escaped.

As I work my tobacco fields, I think about Jamestown's legacy. We proved English people could survive in America. We established representative government. We found economic success. But we also displaced the Powhatans, suffered terrible loss, and now embrace a system of forced labor that troubles my conscience. Our colony is both a triumph and a tragedy, a pattern that will follow America for centuries to come. I'm free now, but I wonder: what kind of freedom are we building here?

This concludes today's lesson. Survival in Jamestown. Thank you for listening.
