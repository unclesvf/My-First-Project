Welcome to today's history lesson. Gettysburg & Vicksburg. Turning Point (1863).

You will hear this story from Sarah, age fifteen, from Gettysburg, eighteen sixty-three.

Chapter One. Our Town Becomes a Battlefield.

I'm Sarah, fifteen years old, and I live in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It's a small town, just 2,400 people, where ten roads meet. We have a Lutheran seminary, a college, farms, shops. It's a peaceful place. Or it was, until July 1863.

June brought rumors of Confederate invasion. General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was marching north through Maryland into Pennsylvania. People were frightened. Some families fled. Others stayed, hoping the armies would pass us by.

June 30. Confederate soldiers appeared on the Chambersburg Pike, west of town. They were foraging for supplies, shoes, food, horses. They didn't stay long, but they'd be back.

July 1 dawned hot and clear. I woke to the sound of distant gunfire. Confederate and Union cavalry were fighting west of town. Then infantry arrived, thousands of soldiers in gray and blue converging on Gettysburg from different roads.

Mother told me to stay in the cellar. From the small window, I could see soldiers running through our streets. Artillery shells exploded. Buildings caught fire. The battle spread through town.

By afternoon, Union forces retreated through Gettysburg to Cemetery Hill, a rise south of town. Confederates pursued, capturing thousands of Union soldiers. Our house became a Confederate aid station. Wounded men filled every room. The carpets soaked with blood. Surgeons amputated limbs on our kitchen table while I helped tend the wounded.

That night, more Union forces arrived, the rest of General George Meade's Army of the Potomac. They took positions on Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and two rocky hills called Little Round Top and Big Round Top. The Confederates held the town and Seminary Ridge, west of Cemetery Ridge.

One hundred sixty thousand soldiers now surrounded Gettysburg. Two massive armies facing each other across open fields. And our town was caught in the middle.

Chapter Two. Day Two—Little Round Top.

July 2. The second day of battle was even more terrible than the first. The fighting shifted south to the Round Tops, rocky, wooded hills at the end of the Union line.

From our cellar, we heard continuous artillery fire. The explosions shook the house. Between bombardments, we heard rifle volleys, thousands of guns firing together, and the screams of wounded men.

A Union soldier who took shelter in our cellar briefly told us what was happening. Confederates were attacking the Union left flank, trying to capture Little Round Top. If they took that hill, they could place artillery there and destroy the Union line on Cemetery Ridge.

Union Colonel Joshua Chamberlain defended Little Round Top with the 20th Maine regiment. They fought for hours, running out of ammunition. Finally, with Confederates charging up the hill and no bullets left, Chamberlain ordered a bayonet charge down the hill. The desperate attack surprised the Confederates and drove them back.

Little Round Top remained in Union hands, barely. If it had fallen, the entire Union position might have collapsed.

Meanwhile, fighting raged at other points: the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, Devil's Den. Thousands of men fought and died in our farm fields. Each location changed hands multiple times.

That evening, the guns finally quieted. Both armies held their positions, exhausted. Our cellar flooded with more wounded. Confederate and Union soldiers lay side by side, too hurt to care which army they belonged to. I gave them water, held their hands, wrote letters home for those who could speak.

One Confederate boy, he couldn't have been older than seventeen, asked me to write to his mother in Georgia. "Tell her I was brave," he said. "Tell her I wasn't scared." He died before dawn. I still have the letter I never sent.

Two days of battle. Thousands dead. And everyone knew the third day would be worse.

Chapter Three. Day Three—Pickett's Charge.

July 3, 1863. The third day of battle. The day Gettysburg became the war's turning point.

The morning was relatively quiet, just scattered skirmishing. Then, at 1 p.m., the Confederate artillery opened up. Over 150 cannons bombarded the Union center on Cemetery Ridge. The noise was unimaginable, constant explosions for nearly two hours. Our house shook. Plaster fell from the ceiling. We huddled in the cellar, praying.

The Union artillery answered. The cannonade was the largest of the war, over 300 cannons firing. The sound must have been heard fifty miles away.

Then, around 3 p.m., the guns quieted. An eerie silence fell. From our cellar window, I saw what happened next.

Fifteen thousand Confederate soldiers emerged from the woods on Seminary Ridge. They formed battle lines, a mile-wide formation in perfect order. Then they began marching across the open fields toward Cemetery Ridge, three-quarters of a mile away.

It was called Pickett's Charge, though three divisions participated, not just George Pickett's. The Confederates advanced slowly, steadily, in parade-ground formation. They looked magnificent and doomed.

Union artillery opened fire. Shells tore gaps in the Confederate ranks. The men closed the gaps and kept marching. Union infantry waited behind a stone wall on Cemetery Ridge. When the Confederates came within rifle range, the Union line erupted in fire.

The slaughter was terrible. Confederate soldiers fell by hundreds, then thousands. Some reached the stone wall, the "High Water Mark of the Confederacy," it's called now. For a few minutes, Confederate soldiers broke through the Union line in hand-to-hand fighting. Then Union reinforcements pushed them back.

The survivors retreated across the blood-soaked field, leaving thousands of dead and wounded behind. Of the 15,000 who charged, fewer than half returned. Pickett's division was destroyed, three brigade commanders killed, all thirteen regimental commanders killed or wounded.

General Lee met the survivors. "It's all my fault," he said. He expected a Union counterattack, but it never came. Meade's army was too battered to pursue.

Chapter Four. The Aftermath.

July 4. Lee's army began retreating to Virginia. The Battle of Gettysburg was over. The Confederacy had lost.

The carnage was unimaginable. Fifty-one thousand men killed, wounded, or missing in three days. Seven thousand dead horses rotting in the summer heat. Every house, barn, and church in Gettysburg filled with wounded. The field hospitals overwhelmed.

For weeks, we cared for the wounded. My mother and I tended dozens of soldiers in our home. Some recovered. Many died. We buried them in our garden because the graveyards filled up.

The smell was terrible, decomposing bodies, gangrene, disease. The town hired workers to bury the dead and burn the horse carcasses. It took weeks. Gettysburg would never be the same.

In November, President Lincoln came to dedicate a national cemetery for the soldiers who died here. Edward Everett, a famous orator, spoke for two hours. Then Lincoln stood and spoke for just two minutes.

I was there, in the crowd. Lincoln's words were simple but powerful: "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

He said we were fighting to ensure "that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." He made the war about more than just preserving the Union, it was about preserving democracy itself and fulfilling the promise that all men are created equal.

The Gettysburg Address lasted just 272 words, but it redefined the war's meaning. We weren't just fighting to preserve the Union. We were fighting for the principle of human equality.

Gettysburg cost us dearly, but it stopped Lee's invasion and broke the Confederacy's offensive power. Lee would never again invade the North. The war would continue nearly two more years, but after Gettysburg, Confederate victory became impossible.

Chapter Five. Vicksburg—The River Runs Free.

The same day Lee retreated from Gettysburg, July 4, 1863, another momentous victory occurred a thousand miles away. Vicksburg, Mississippi, surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant after a 47-day siege.

We learned about it days later through the newspapers. The news was almost as important as Gettysburg, though it felt distant from our Pennsylvania town.

Vicksburg sat on high bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. Confederates called it the "Gibraltar of the Confederacy." As long as they held Vicksburg, they controlled a crucial stretch of the Mississippi, keeping the Confederacy connected between east and west.

Grant had tried for months to capture Vicksburg through conventional attacks. All failed. So he changed strategy. He marched his army south along the west bank of the Mississippi, crossed below Vicksburg, then circled behind the city, cutting it off from supplies and reinforcements.

Confederate General John Pemberton had 30,000 troops in Vicksburg. Rather than risk losing them in battle, he retreated into the city's fortifications. Grant besieged the city, bombarding it with artillery and digging trenches closer and closer to Confederate lines.

For 47 days, Vicksburg's civilians and soldiers endured constant bombardment. They dug caves in the hillsides to escape the shells. Food ran out, they ate horses, mules, even rats. Disease spread. Finally, on July 4, Pemberton surrendered.

The Mississippi River now belonged to the Union. The Confederacy was cut in half. Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas were isolated from the rest of the Confederate states. Supplies and troops from these western states could no longer reach the eastern armies.

President Lincoln said, "The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea." The river that had been contested for two years now flowed freely under Union control.

Together, Gettysburg and Vicksburg marked the war's turning point. Before July 1863, Confederate victory was possible. After, it became a matter of when, not if, the Union would win.

But the war ground on. Lee's army, though defeated at Gettysburg, remained dangerous. The Confederacy fought desperately for nearly two more years. More men would die, more towns would be destroyed, before the war finally ended. But here in Gettysburg, in early July 1863, we witnessed the moment when the tide turned, when the Union began winning a war that would preserve the nation and end slavery.

This concludes today's lesson. Gettysburg & Vicksburg. Thank you for listening.
