Welcome to today's history lesson. City Upon a Hill. The Massachusetts Bay Colony (1630-1650).

You will hear this story from John, age thirteen, son of a Puritan minister in Boston, sixteen thirty.

Chapter One. A Holy Experiment.

My name is John, and I am thirteen years old. My father is a Puritan minister who came to Massachusetts Bay with Governor John Winthrop. Unlike the Pilgrims at Plymouth, we didn't want to separate from the Church of England, we wanted to purify it from within.

Governor Winthrop told us we were building a "city upon a hill," a model Christian community that the world would look to as an example. This was not just about religious freedom for us, it was about creating God's perfect society in the New World.

We arrived with about 1,000 colonists, far more than Plymouth started with. We had money, supplies, and educated leaders. The Massachusetts Bay Company charter gave us the right to govern ourselves, and we brought the charter with us to America. This meant England couldn't easily control us from across the ocean.

But our "freedom" came with strict rules. Everyone had to attend our Puritan church. We had no tolerance for other beliefs. Father says that true freedom means freedom to do what is right, not freedom to do what is wrong. I sometimes wonder about this.

Chapter Two. Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson.

Not everyone agreed with our strict ways. Roger Williams, a young minister, preached that the government shouldn't enforce religious laws. He said colonists should pay Native Americans for their land, not just take it. He believed in separation of church and state.

The authorities banished him. He fled south in winter and was saved by the Narragansett people. He founded Rhode Island, where people could worship freely. Some called it "Rogue's Island" because it tolerated all beliefs.

Then came Anne Hutchinson. She held Bible study meetings in her home where she questioned some of our ministers' teachings. Women listened to her ideas about salvation and grace. The authorities said she was dangerous, how could a woman presume to teach theology?

They put her on trial. I watched from the back of the meetinghouse as she defended herself brilliantly, using Scripture to answer every charge. But it didn't matter. They banished her too. She went to Rhode Island, and later to New York, where she was killed in a raid. Many said it was God's judgment, but I wonder if God really punishes people for thinking differently.

Chapter Three. Sundays and Scrutiny.

Living in our "city upon a hill" means constant watchfulness, of ourselves and our neighbors. Last Sunday, the Goodman family was fined for their son laughing too loudly during services. Father says frivolity has no place in worship, but sometimes I wonder if God truly frowns upon a child's joy.

Our Sabbath begins Saturday evening at sunset and continues until Sunday sunset. We cannot cook, travel, play, or work. We attend two long services, each lasting three hours or more. Father preaches about sin and salvation while the congregation sits on hard benches in the unheated meetinghouse. In winter, my fingers grow numb holding my Bible.

The tithing man walks up and down the aisles with a long pole. One end has a feather to tickle awake drowsy women; the other end has a hard knob to rap the heads of sleeping men. I've felt that knob twice, and it hurts far worse than the shame.

We must dress modestly always, no bright colors, no lace, no jewelry. Mother wears only gray and brown. When a woman from England visited wearing a purple ribbon, the magistrates made her remove it publicly. They said such vanity invites the Devil's attention. I see how people's eyes follow anyone who seems different, marking them for correction.

Chapter Four. The Puritan Way of Life.

Our colony thrived despite these controversies. We built towns around meetinghouses and common greens. Education mattered deeply to us, every town with 50 families had to hire a schoolmaster. In 1636, we founded Harvard College to train ministers.

We established a covenant community where church members could vote and hold office. It wasn't democracy for everyone, you had to be a male church member, but it gave many men a voice in government. Our town meetings became a foundation of American self-government.

We created laws based on the Bible, our "Puritan ethic" of hard work, thrift, and moral living. We wore plain clothes, avoided frivolity, and worked six days a week. Sunday was the Sabbath, a day of rest and worship where no work was permitted.

By 1640, about 20,000 colonists lived in Massachusetts Bay. We were the largest and most powerful New England colony. But I've learned that building a "city upon a hill" is harder than it sounds. How do you create a perfect society when people disagree about what perfection means?

Chapter Five. Questions Without Answers.

Now at seventeen, I've watched our colony grow from a holy experiment into something more complex. We banished Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson for their beliefs, yet we ourselves fled England to escape religious persecution. Father says this is different, we enforce God's true will, but the contradiction troubles me.

I've seen Winthrop's vision of charity and community produce remarkable things. When families struggle, neighbors help with barn-raisings and harvest. When sickness strikes, we care for each other. Our schools ensure even common children can read Scripture. These are noble achievements that spring from our shared covenant.

Yet I've also seen how our certainty can become cruelty. We banish dissenters and brand those who question our authority. We execute those we suspect of witchcraft. We take Native lands while calling ourselves righteous. The gap between our ideals and our actions weighs upon my conscience.

Father tells me doubt is the Devil's whisper, but I believe these questions matter. Perhaps a "city upon a hill" isn't about perfection, it's about striving, failing, and learning. The world watches us not to copy us exactly, but to learn from both our successes and our mistakes. That legacy may be more valuable than the perfect society we sought to build.

This concludes today's lesson. City Upon a Hill. Thank you for listening.
