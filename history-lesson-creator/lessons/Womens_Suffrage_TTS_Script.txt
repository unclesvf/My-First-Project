Welcome to today's history lesson. Women's Suffrage. Winning the Vote (1848-1920).

You will hear this story from Alice, age sixteen, suffragist, nineteen twenty.

Chapter One. Seneca Falls to Susan B. Anthony.

I'm Alice, sixteen years old, and today, August 26, 1920, I watched my mother vote for the first time in her life. The Nineteenth Amendment has been ratified. Women have won the right to vote after 72 years of struggle.

The fight began at Seneca Falls, New York in 1848. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized the first women's rights convention. Three hundred people attended. They issued the Declaration of Sentiments, modeled on the Declaration of Independence:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal."

The declaration listed grievances: women couldn't vote, couldn't own property after marriage, couldn't attend college, couldn't enter most professions, had no legal rights to their own children. The convention demanded women's suffrage, the right to vote.

Many supporters of women's rights thought demanding the vote was too radical. Even some women's rights advocates believed women weren't ready for political participation. But Stanton and others insisted voting rights were fundamental to equality.

Susan B. Anthony joined the movement in 1851. She and Stanton became partners, traveling the country giving speeches, organizing conventions, petitioning legislatures. They faced ridicule, rotten eggs thrown at speeches, newspapers calling them unwomanly and dangerous.

In 1872, Anthony voted illegally in Rochester, New York to test whether the Fourteenth Amendment (which made "all persons born or naturalized in the United States" citizens) gave women the right to vote. She was arrested, tried, and fined. The judge wouldn't let her testify in her own defense because she was a woman. She refused to pay the fine.

Anthony and Stanton spent decades fighting for a federal suffrage amendment. They died without seeing victory, Stanton in 1902, Anthony in 1906. But they built a movement that would eventually succeed.

Chapter Two. Two Strategies—NAWSA and the NWP.

By the early 1900s, the suffrage movement split into two organizations with different strategies.

The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), led by Carrie Chapman Catt, pursued a state-by-state strategy. They lobbied state legislatures to grant women voting rights, believing success at the state level would build momentum for a federal amendment. Wyoming granted women's suffrage in 1869, followed by Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and eventually fifteen states by 1914.

NAWSA's approach was moderate and patient. They emphasized that women voters would support reforms like prohibition, child labor laws, and political corruption. They avoided confrontation, worked within the system, and sought to prove women were responsible enough for political participation.

Alice Paul took a different approach. She founded the National Woman's Party (NWP) in 1916. Paul had participated in the British suffrage movement, where women used militant tactics, hunger strikes, property destruction, public protests.

Paul brought those tactics to America. In January 1917, the NWP began picketing the White House, the first group ever to do so. Women called "Silent Sentinels" stood outside the White House holding signs: "Mister President, How Long Must Women Wait for Liberty?" and "Democracy Should Begin at Home."

When America entered World War I in April 1917, the picketers continued, which outraged many Americans. How could women protest during wartime? The picketers carried signs quoting President Wilson's own words about democracy and self-determination, asking why those principles didn't apply to American women.

Police arrested over 200 picketers for "obstructing traffic." In prison, they were beaten, confined to filthy cells, and force-fed when they went on hunger strikes. Paul herself was force-fed, a brutal procedure where guards held her down and pushed a tube down her throat to pour liquid food into her stomach.

The brutality backfired. Public sympathy turned toward the suffragists. Women who endured imprisonment and force-feeding for the right to vote seemed heroic, not radical.

Chapter Three. The Final Push—Wilson Changes His Mind.

President Woodrow Wilson initially opposed women's suffrage, saying it was a state issue, not a federal one. But the combination of NAWSA's lobbying, the NWP's protests, and women's contributions to the war effort changed his mind.

During World War I, women took jobs in factories, served as nurses, sold war bonds, and managed farms while men fought overseas. They proved they could handle responsibilities traditionally reserved for men. The war demonstrated that women were full participants in American society who deserved full citizenship rights.

In January 1918, Wilson announced his support for a federal suffrage amendment. He called it a "war measure" necessary for morale and credibility. How could America claim to fight for democracy abroad while denying it to half its citizens at home?

The House of Representatives passed the amendment in January 1918 by exactly the two-thirds majority required. The Senate was harder. Suffragists lobbied intensely. Finally, in June 1919, the Senate passed the amendment.

Then came ratification, thirty-six states (three-fourths of the forty-eight states) needed to approve it. Suffragists organized in every state. Anti-suffragists fought back, arguing women's suffrage would destroy families, lead to moral decay, and give Black women the vote (a racist argument used especially in the South).

The ratification battle went state by state. By August 1920, thirty-five states had ratified. Tennessee was the final state needed. The Tennessee legislature was evenly divided. One young legislator, Harry Burn, planned to vote against ratification. But his mother sent him a letter: "Be a good boy... and vote for suffrage." He switched his vote. Tennessee ratified by one vote.

On August 26, 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment became law: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."

Chapter Four. The First Vote.

November 2, 1920. The first presidential election where women can vote nationwide. Mother and I go to the polling place together. She's forty-five years old and voting for the first time.

The polling place is crowded. Men who've voted their whole lives stand in line alongside women voting for the first time. Some men are supportive. Others grumble about women in politics. A few make rude comments. Mother ignores them.

When it's Mother's turn, the poll worker hands her a ballot. Her hands shake slightly. She's waited her entire adult life for this moment. She marks her ballot carefully, then drops it in the box.

"I voted," she says, tears in her eyes. "I actually voted."

Later, at home, we talk about the suffragists who made this possible. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who demanded the vote when it seemed impossible. Susan B. Anthony, who fought for fifty years and died before victory. Carrie Chapman Catt, whose state-by-state strategy built the foundation. Alice Paul, whose militant tactics forced action.

Millions of women, whose names aren't remembered, who attended meetings, signed petitions, gave speeches, marched in parades, endured ridicule and sometimes violence. Women who believed in a principle and fought for it across generations.

Mother tells me about her mother, my grandmother, who attended suffrage meetings in the 1890s. Grandmother died in 1915, five years before victory. "She would have been so happy to see this," Mother says.

The suffrage movement proves that change is possible even when it seems impossible. For 72 years, from Seneca Falls to the Nineteenth Amendment, women fought against entrenched opposition. They faced arguments that women were too emotional, too delicate, too ignorant for politics. They faced laws that treated them as property, not citizens. They endured arrest, imprisonment, and force-feeding.

But they persisted. And they won.

Chapter Five. Victory Incomplete.

The celebration is joyful but also bittersweet. We've won a crucial victory, but equality is far from achieved.

First, many Black women still can't vote. The Nineteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination "on account of sex," but Southern states use the same Jim Crow tactics against Black women that they use against Black men: poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, violence, and intimidation. Black women fought for suffrage too, leaders like Mary Church Terrell and Ida B. Wells worked for both women's rights and civil rights. But they won't fully exercise voting rights until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

Second, Native American women can't vote because Native Americans aren't citizens. That won't change until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.

Third, in some states, poll taxes prevent poor women of all races from voting. These won't be abolished until the Twenty-Fourth Amendment in 1964.

Fourth, winning the vote doesn't mean winning equality. Women still face discrimination in employment, education, property rights, and family law. We can't serve on juries in many states. We're paid less than men for the same work. Professions like law and medicine remain largely closed to us. Married women often can't own property or sign contracts without their husbands' permission.

The suffrage movement itself had significant flaws. Many white suffragists excluded or marginalized Black women. Some used racist arguments, claiming educated white women deserved the vote more than "ignorant" Black men. The movement prioritized gender over race, sometimes collaborating with racist politicians to gain support.

Mother and I talk about this. "The vote is a tool," she says, "not the goal. The goal is full equality, economic, legal, social. We've won the tool. Now we use it to achieve the goal."

I'm sixteen, part of the first generation of American women growing up with the right to vote. I won't take it for granted. I'll vote in every election. I'll use my voice in politics. I'll fight for the further reforms needed to achieve genuine equality.

The suffragists taught me that change requires sustained struggle. They fought for 72 years. Some dedicated their entire lives to a cause they didn't live to see succeed. They believed in a principle, that women are equal citizens entitled to equal rights, and they fought for it despite obstacles.

That principle still requires fighting for. Winning the vote is a milestone, not the destination. Our daughters and granddaughters will continue the work we're starting. Each generation moves closer to genuine equality. The suffragists showed us it's possible. Now it's our turn to continue the fight.

This concludes today's lesson. Women's Suffrage. Thank you for listening.
