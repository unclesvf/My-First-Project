Welcome to today's history lesson. The Rough Rider President. Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive Era (1901-1909).

You will hear this story from Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President of the United States, nineteen oh one.

Chapter One. From Sickly Boy to Rough Rider.

My name is Theodore Roosevelt, and I was not supposed to survive childhood. Born in 1858 to a wealthy New York family, I suffered from terrible asthma that left me gasping for breath, weak and confined indoors while other boys played. The doctors said I had a weak constitution and would never be strong.

But my father took me aside one day and said, "Theodore, you have the mind but not the body, and without the body the mind cannot go as far as it should. You must make your body." Those words changed my life.

I threw myself into physical fitness with the same intensity I brought to everything. Boxing, weightlifting, horseback riding, hiking, I pushed my body to its limits and beyond. I transformed myself from a sickly child into a robust, energetic young man. This taught me a lesson I never forgot: with determination and hard work, a person can overcome any obstacle.

I attended Harvard, married my sweetheart Alice, and entered politics as a New York State Assemblyman. I was young, brash, and eager to fight corruption. But tragedy struck when both my mother and my wife died on the same day in 1884. Devastated, I fled to the Dakota Territory to ranch and rebuild my spirit.

The West changed me. I lived as a cowboy, hunted buffalo, captured outlaws, and learned to appreciate the vast American wilderness. When I returned to New York, I was stronger in body and spirit, ready to continue my work in public service.

In 1898, when war with Spain erupted, I resigned my position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy to form a volunteer cavalry regiment, the Rough Riders. We charged up San Juan Hill in Cuba, and I returned home a war hero. This catapulted me to the governorship of New York, then to the vice presidency under William McKinley.

Chapter Two. An Accidental President.

On September 14, 1901, I became President of the United States at age 42, the youngest president in American history. But I did not want it to happen this way.

President McKinley had been shot by an assassin eight days earlier at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo. When I received the telegram that he was dying, I rushed to Buffalo, but arrived too late. McKinley was dead, and I was now President.

Republican Party bosses had made me vice president to sideline me, they thought I was too radical, too energetic, too unpredictable. Senator Mark Hanna famously said, "Now that damn cowboy is President!" They were right to worry. I had no intention of being a caretaker president.

I immediately made it clear I would continue McKinley's cabinet, providing stability during the transition. But I also signaled that things would change. "I wish to be a good President," I told reporters, "and to do this I must have the support of the people."

The presidency gave me a "bully pulpit", a wonderful platform from which to advocate for the causes I believed in. And I believed in using the federal government to help ordinary Americans against the powerful special interests that dominated the Gilded Age.

My philosophy was simple: a Square Deal for every American. The government should act as an honest broker between labor and capital, between big business and the common man. No group should be able to dominate and exploit the others. This was a radical idea in 1901, when many believed government should leave business completely alone.

Chapter Three. Trust-Busting and the Square Deal.

America in 1901 was dominated by massive corporations, trusts, that controlled entire industries. J.P. Morgan's banking empire, John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, Carnegie's steel monopoly, these men had more power than most governments. They fixed prices, crushed competitors, exploited workers, and corrupted politics.

Previous presidents had done little to challenge them. But I believed these trusts threatened democracy itself. When wealth becomes too concentrated, political power follows, and ordinary citizens lose their voice.

My first major act was to break up the Northern Securities Company, a railroad trust that J.P. Morgan himself had created. When Morgan came to the White House and said, "If we have done anything wrong, send your man to my man and they can fix it up," I replied, "That can't be done." Morgan was shocked that a President would treat him like an ordinary citizen subject to the law.

We won the case in the Supreme Court, and I earned the nickname "Trust-Buster." Over my presidency, we brought 44 antitrust suits, breaking up monopolies and restoring competition. I wasn't against big business, I recognized that large corporations were often more efficient. But I insisted they play fair and serve the public interest.

The Coal Strike of 1902 tested my principles. Coal miners, working in terrible conditions for poverty wages, went on strike. Mine owners refused to negotiate. As winter approached, Americans faced freezing without coal for heat. Previous presidents would have sent troops to break the strike.

Instead, I threatened to seize the mines and run them with Army troops unless owners negotiated. Shocked that a president would side with workers over capital, the owners agreed to arbitration. The miners got better wages and shorter hours. For the first time, a president had used federal power to help workers rather than crush them.

Chapter Four. Conservation: Preserving America's Natural Heritage.

Of all my achievements, I am most proud of my conservation work. I was America's first conservation president, and I used every power at my disposal to protect our natural heritage.

Growing up, I loved nature, studying birds, collecting specimens, exploring forests. Out West as a young man, I saw the destruction firsthand: forests stripped bare, wildlife hunted to near extinction, beautiful landscapes ruined by unchecked exploitation. I realized that unless we acted, future generations would inherit a wasteland.

I believed in conservation, not preservation. Conservation means using natural resources wisely and sustainably, ensuring they last for future generations. We shouldn't lock away all wilderness, but neither should we destroy it for short-term profit.

I established 5 National Parks, 18 National Monuments, 51 Federal Bird Reserves, and 150 National Forests, protecting approximately 230 million acres. I created the U.S. Forest Service under Gifford Pinchot to manage these lands scientifically. I used every legal tool available, sometimes stretching my authority to its limits.

When Congress tried to stop me from creating more National Forests in the West, I worked around the clock with Pinchot to designate 21 new forests in a single week, then signed the bill limiting my authority. Congress was furious, but the forests were protected.

Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Devils Tower, Muir Woods, these treasures exist today because we fought to save them. I took John Muir camping in Yosemite, sleeping under the giant sequoias, and he convinced me these ancient groves must be preserved forever.

I also championed scientific management of wildlife. We saved the bison from extinction, protected migratory birds, and established the first wildlife refuges. Conservation wasn't just about scenery, it was about ensuring America's resources would sustain our children and grandchildren.

Chapter Five. Speaking Softly and Carrying a Big Stick.

"Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far." This West African proverb became my motto for foreign policy. I believed America should be strong, confident, and willing to use power, but preferably to avoid war rather than wage it.

When I became president, America was emerging as a world power after our victory in the Spanish-American War. We had possessions in the Caribbean and Pacific. The question was: what kind of world power would we be?

I believed in a strong navy, "the big stick" that made others take us seriously. I expanded the Navy, building modern battleships and eventually sending the Great White Fleet around the world to demonstrate American power. When critics said it was too expensive, I replied that a strong navy prevented wars we couldn't afford to fight.

The Panama Canal was my greatest foreign policy achievement. For centuries, ships had to sail around South America to move between the Atlantic and Pacific. A canal through Central America would revolutionize trade and military mobility.

When Colombia rejected our treaty to build a canal through its province of Panama, I supported Panamanian independence. Some called this imperialism. I called it getting things done. The canal opened in 1914, one of the greatest engineering achievements in history, and it remains vital to world commerce today.

In 1905, I mediated the peace treaty ending the Russo-Japanese War, becoming the first American to win the Nobel Peace Prize. I proved America could be a global peacemaker, not just a military power.

I also issued the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, declaring that the United States would intervene in Latin American countries to prevent European intervention. Critics called this the "Big Stick" policy, imposing American will on smaller nations. I believed it was necessary to maintain stability and prevent European colonialism from returning to our hemisphere.

Chapter Six. The Bully Pulpit and Progressive Legacy.

I loved being President. The presidency gave me what I called a "bully pulpit", a platform to speak directly to the American people and advocate for the causes I believed in. And I used it constantly.

I broke presidential precedents right and left. I was the first president to invite an African American, Booker T. Washington, to dine at the White House, causing a scandal in the segregated South. I championed pure food and drug laws after reading Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle," which exposed horrific conditions in meatpacking plants. I supported workers' rights, regulated railroads, and protected consumers.

I believed in what I called "the stewardship theory" of the presidency. The president is a steward of the people, and should do anything necessary for their welfare unless explicitly forbidden by the Constitution. This was revolutionary, previous presidents took a narrow view of their powers.

I also believed in merit, not connections. I appointed people based on competence, not political favors. I started civil service reform, making government more professional and less corrupt.

When I left office in 1909, voluntarily stepping aside after nearly two full terms, I was only 50 years old, younger than most presidents when they're elected. I had transformed the presidency from a relatively weak office into the center of American government.

My Progressive policies, regulating big business, protecting consumers and workers, conserving natural resources, and using federal power to promote fairness, became the template for 20th century American government. My cousin Franklin would build on this foundation during the New Deal.

I showed that government could be a force for good, protecting ordinary people from powerful interests without destroying capitalism. That was my Square Deal: fairness, opportunity, and justice for all Americans, with special privileges for none. It is the legacy I am most proud of, and the principle that should guide every president who follows.

This concludes today's lesson. The Rough Rider President. Thank you for listening.
