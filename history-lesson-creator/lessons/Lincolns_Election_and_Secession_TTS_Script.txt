Welcome to today's history lesson. Lincoln's Election & Secession. The Union Breaks (1860-1861).

You will hear this story from William, age fifteen, from South Carolina, eighteen sixty.

Chapter One. The Election of 1860.

I'm William, fifteen years old, from Charleston, South Carolina. The presidential election of 1860 has our city in turmoil. Father says this election will determine whether we remain in the Union or leave it.

The election is complicated. Four major candidates are running. The Democratic Party split along sectional lines. Northern Democrats nominated Stephen Douglas, supporting popular sovereignty. Southern Democrats nominated John Breckinridge, demanding federal protection of slavery in all territories.

The Constitutional Union Party, trying to avoid the slavery issue entirely, nominated John Bell. They call for preserving the Union without taking sides on slavery.

And then there's Abraham Lincoln, the Republican candidate. Republicans oppose slavery's expansion into the territories, though they promise not to interfere with slavery where it already exists. Their platform says slavery is morally wrong and must be contained.

No Republican has ever won the presidency. Their party didn't even exist six years ago. And they're not even on the ballot in most Southern states, including South Carolina. We can't vote for Lincoln even if we wanted to, which we don't.

Father and his friends talk constantly about what they'll do if Lincoln wins. "A Black Republican president," they call him, though Lincoln isn't actually radical on slavery. He just opposes its expansion. But to Southerners, that's enough. Father says Lincoln's election would be a declaration that the North has permanent control of the government and will slowly strangle slavery to death.

"We won't submit to rule by a sectional Northern party," Father says. "If Lincoln wins, South Carolina will secede from the Union."

I'm not sure what to think. All my life I've been taught that South Carolina is part of the United States. I've learned about Washington and Jefferson, the Constitution and the Union. Now Father says we'll leave? It's frightening and exciting at once.

Chapter Two. Lincoln Wins—The South Reacts.

November 6, 1860. Election results arrive by telegraph. Abraham Lincoln has won the presidency. He carried every Northern state except New Jersey (which he split with Douglas). He didn't win a single Southern state, didn't even appear on the ballot in most of them. He won with 40% of the popular vote but a clear majority of electoral votes.

Charleston erupts. Church bells ring. Crowds gather in the streets. But they're not celebrating Lincoln's victory, they're celebrating South Carolina's decision to leave the Union.

The palmetto flag, South Carolina's state flag, is raised across the city. Men wear blue cockades (ribbons) in their hats to show support for secession. Militia companies parade through the streets. There's talk of seizing federal forts and arsenals.

Father comes home from a meeting. "The legislature has called a special convention," he tells Mother. "We'll vote on secession in December. It's really happening."

I ask if war is coming. Father pauses. "Lincoln can't force us to stay in the Union. That would be tyranny. We have the right to govern ourselves. If we leave peacefully, there's no reason for war."

But Mother looks worried. "What if Lincoln doesn't let us leave peacefully?"

"Then we'll defend ourselves," Father says. "But it won't come to that. Once several states secede, Lincoln will have to accept it. The North won't go to war to force us back into the Union."

I'm not so sure. I remember Uncle Tom visiting from Boston last year. He said Northerners would never allow the Union to be dissolved. "You can't just leave whenever you lose an election," he said. Father and Uncle Tom argued so fiercely they haven't spoken since.

December 20, 1860. South Carolina's secession convention meets in Charleston. The vote is unanimous: 169-0 to secede from the United States. We're now an independent republic, the first state to leave the Union.

The news spreads rapidly. Crowds celebrate in the streets. Cannons fire salutes. We've done what we've threatened for decades. South Carolina has seceded.

Chapter Three. The Confederacy Forms.

South Carolina's secession triggers a chain reaction. Within weeks, six more states of the Deep South follow: Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. All cite Lincoln's election and Northern hostility to slavery as reasons for leaving.

In February 1861, delegates from the seceded states meet in Montgomery, Alabama. They form a new nation: the Confederate States of America. They write a constitution, similar to the U.S. Constitution but explicitly protecting slavery. They elect Jefferson Davis of Mississippi as president and Alexander Stephens of Georgia as vice president.

Stephens gives a speech explaining the Confederacy's foundation. He says the United States was founded on the false idea "that all men are created equal." The Confederacy, he says, is founded on the opposite principle: "that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition."

I'm at the dinner table when Father reads Stephens's speech from the newspaper. He nods approvingly. "Finally, someone speaking the truth," he says.

I feel uncomfortable but don't say anything. Mother, who's never liked slavery much but accepts it, looks troubled. My older sister Sarah asks, "But Father, isn't slavery wrong? Reverend Thompson has preached that all souls are equal before God."

Father's face hardens. "Reverend Thompson is a fool if he said that. The Bible supports slavery. Ham's descendants were cursed to servitude. Slavery is ordained by God and nature."

The conversation ends. But Sarah's question stays with me. I've grown up in a slaveholding society. Our family owns three enslaved people who work our farm and household. I've never questioned it before. But now, as we create a new nation explicitly founded on slavery, I wonder if we're on the right side.

Eight slave states remain in the Union: Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. They're waiting to see what happens. If Lincoln uses force against the Confederacy, they'll likely secede too. If he accepts Confederate independence peacefully, they'll likely stay.

Everything depends on what happens next.

Chapter Four. The Fort Sumter Crisis.

Charleston Harbor, March 1861. Fort Sumter, a federal fort on an island in our harbor, remains under Union control. Major Robert Anderson commands about 80 U.S. soldiers there. Confederate forces surround the fort from batteries on the shore.

President Lincoln took office on March 4. In his inaugural address, he said he won't interfere with slavery where it exists but will preserve the Union. He says secession is unconstitutional: "No state can lawfully leave the Union." But he also promises not to invade the South unless provoked.

Fort Sumter is the test. If Lincoln abandons it, he accepts Confederate independence. If he reinforces it, it's an act of war. Lincoln decides to send supplies but not weapons, provisions to keep the garrison fed but no military reinforcement.

Confederate President Davis faces a dilemma too. If he allows resupply, it accepts continued federal presence in Charleston Harbor. If he attacks, he starts a war the Confederacy might not win.

I watch from the battery with Father on April 11. Confederate General Beauregard sends a message to Major Anderson demanding surrender. Anderson refuses but says they'll run out of food in a few days anyway.

That's not good enough for the Confederacy. At 4:30 a.m. on April 12, 1861, Confederate batteries open fire on Fort Sumter. I wake to the sound of cannons. The bombardment lasts 34 hours. We fire thousands of shells at the fort. Buildings catch fire. The barracks burn. Anderson's men take shelter in the lower level.

Miraculously, no one is killed in the bombardment. On April 13, with the fort in ruins and fires raging, Anderson surrenders. Confederate forces allow him to evacuate his garrison with full military honors.

I watch the American flag come down from Fort Sumter. The Confederate flag goes up in its place. Charleston celebrates like we've won a great victory. But I feel uneasy. We've fired on the United States flag. We've started a war. There's no going back now.

Chapter Five. The Nation Chooses Sides.

April 15, 1861. President Lincoln responds to Fort Sumter's fall by calling for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion. He's calling us rebels. He's asking Northern states to provide troops to invade the South.

The effect is immediate. The Upper South states, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas, had resisted secession. But they won't provide troops to fight against other Southern states. Within weeks, all four secede and join the Confederacy.

Virginia's secession is the most significant. It's the most populous Southern state, the wealthiest, the most industrialized. Richmond becomes the Confederate capital. Robert E. Lee, offered command of the Union army, resigns his U.S. commission and joins Virginia. "I cannot raise my hand against my birthplace, my home, my children," he says.

The Confederacy now has eleven states. But four slave states stay in the Union: Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. Lincoln works desperately to keep them. Maryland, surrounding Washington D.C., is crucial, losing it would isolate the capital. Kentucky controls the Ohio River. Missouri controls the Mississippi River.

In Charleston, the war fever is intense. Thousands of young men volunteer for the Confederate army. They think the war will be short, one big battle, and the Yankees will give up. "We'll whip them in three months," Father says. He's too old to enlist, but my older cousin James joins a Charleston regiment.

I'm fifteen, too young to enlist yet. Part of me is relieved. Another part feels guilty for not being more eager to fight for our new nation.

Mother cries when James leaves. "It won't be as easy as they think," she says quietly to me. "The North has more people, more factories, more railroads. They won't let us go without a terrible fight."

The Union has 22 million people. The Confederacy has 9 million, of whom 3.5 million are enslaved. The North has most of the factories, railroads, and banks. The South has cotton, "King Cotton," we call it, which we believe will bring Britain and France to our aid.

Two nations now occupy the space that was once the United States. The Confederacy believes it's fighting for independence and self-government, like the American Revolution. The Union believes it's fighting to preserve the nation and prove that democracy can survive.

I stand on the battery in Charleston Harbor, looking at Fort Sumter flying the Confederate flag. A war has begun that will determine America's future. Neither side knows it will last four years, cost 750,000 lives, and end slavery forever. We think we're fighting for our rights and our way of life. History will judge whether we were on the right side.

This concludes today's lesson. Lincoln's Election & Secession. Thank you for listening.
