Welcome to today's history lesson. World War I. The Great War (1914-1918).

You will hear this story from James, age eighteen, American soldier in France, nineteen eighteen.

Chapter One. The Great War Begins.

I'm James, eighteen years old, and I'm an American soldier in France. The war has been raging since 1914, four years of brutal combat that has killed millions and devastated Europe.

The war started with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in June 1914. Within weeks, Europe's alliance system pulled nation after nation into conflict. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Russia mobilized to defend Serbia. Germany declared war on Russia and France. Britain entered to defend Belgium. The Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined Germany and Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). Italy, Japan, and eventually many other nations joined Britain, France, and Russia (the Allies).

The war quickly became a stalemate. On the Western Front in France and Belgium, opposing armies dug trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. For four years, millions of soldiers lived in those trenches, muddy, rat-infested ditches, launching attacks that gained yards of ground at the cost of thousands of lives.

New weapons made the war horrifically deadly. Machine guns mowed down soldiers attacking across no-man's-land. Artillery bombardments destroyed everything. Poison gas, chlorine, phosgene, mustard gas, choked and blinded soldiers. Tanks, airplanes, and submarines changed warfare forever.

President Woodrow Wilson kept America neutral for three years. "Too proud to fight," he said. Many Americans agreed, this was a European war, not our business. But events pulled us in.

Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare targeted all ships, including American vessels. In May 1915, a German U-boat sank the Lusitania, killing 1,198 people including 128 Americans. Wilson protested, and Germany temporarily halted unrestricted submarine warfare.

But in January 1917, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare, hoping to starve Britain before America could intervene. Then British intelligence intercepted the Zimmermann Telegram, a German message to Mexico proposing an alliance. If Mexico attacked the United States, Germany would help Mexico reclaim Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.

Americans were outraged. On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war on Germany.

Chapter Two. Over There—American Doughboys in France.

"Over there, over there, Send the word, send the word over there, That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming... And we won't come back till it's over, over there."

George M. Cohan's song captures American enthusiasm as we entered the war. We called ourselves "doughboys", the nickname for American soldiers. We were confident, enthusiastic, and completely unprepared for what we'd face.

I enlisted in May 1917, trained for six months, and shipped to France in November. The troopship was crowded and uncomfortable. Many soldiers got seasick. But we were excited. We'd heard stories about heroism and glory. We thought war would be an adventure.

Arriving in France shattered our illusions. The trenches are hell on earth. Imagine living in a muddy ditch, four feet wide and six feet deep, for weeks or months. Rats everywhere, some as big as cats, feeding on corpses. Lice infest our clothes and hair. When it rains, trenches flood. We stand in water for days, developing trench foot, a painful condition where feet swell and rot.

The smell is indescribable: mud, sweat, unwashed bodies, latrines, poison gas, and death, the sickly sweet smell of decomposing bodies in no-man's-land that we can't reach to bury.

The noise is constant. Artillery bombardments shake the earth. Shells explode randomly, killing or maiming. We learn to distinguish sounds, the whistle of incoming shells, the different calibers of guns, the rattle of machine gun fire.

Going "over the top", leaving the trench to attack, is terrifying. Officers blow whistles. We climb ladders and run across no-man's-land toward enemy trenches. Machine guns open fire. Men fall by the dozens. Artillery shells explode. Those who reach the enemy trench fight with rifles, grenades, and bayonets.

Attacks rarely succeed. We might capture a few hundred yards at the cost of thousands of lives. Then the enemy counter-attacks and retakes the ground. The front barely moves, but the casualty lists grow longer every day.

Chapter Three. The Tide Turns.

By spring 1918, Germany launched a massive offensive, trying to win before American troops arrived in force. They broke through Allied lines, advancing toward Paris. For weeks, the outcome was uncertain. Would Germany win before America could tip the balance?

Then the flood of American troops turned the tide. Over two million American soldiers reached France by late 1918. We were fresh, enthusiastic, and numerous. We lacked the experience of British and French troops who'd fought for four years, but we had energy and numbers.

The Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918 stopped the German advance. American forces played a crucial role. Then came the Hundred Days Offensive, a series of Allied attacks from August to November that pushed German forces back.

I fought in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, the largest American battle of the war. Over one million American soldiers attacked German positions in eastern France. The fighting was brutal. In 47 days, we suffered 26,000 dead and 95,000 wounded. But we broke through German lines.

By November, Germany's army was collapsing. Food shortages at home caused riots. The German navy mutinied. The Kaiser abdicated. On November 11, 1918, at 11 a.m., the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, the armistice took effect. The guns finally fell silent.

I was in the trenches when the ceasefire began. At 10:59, artillery fired. At 11:00, silence. After four years of constant noise, the quiet was eerie. Men cried, cheered, prayed. We'd survived. The war was over.

But the cost was staggering. Over 9 million soldiers dead worldwide. 21 million wounded. Entire generation of young men decimated. 116,000 Americans dead, 204,000 wounded. Families across America mourned sons, brothers, husbands, fathers.

The "war to end all wars," Wilson called it. Standing in those trenches, seeing the devastation, I desperately wanted to believe him.

Chapter Four. Wilson's Fourteen Points and the Treaty of Versailles.

President Wilson arrived in Paris for the peace conference with an idealistic vision. His Fourteen Points, announced in January 1918, outlined principles for lasting peace:

• No secret treaties, open diplomacy
• Freedom of the seas
• Free trade among nations
• Reduced armaments
• Adjustment of colonial claims considering native peoples' interests
• Self-determination for European peoples, letting nations govern themselves
• League of Nations, an international organization to prevent future wars

European leaders were less idealistic. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, French Premier Georges Clemenceau, and Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando wanted to punish Germany and protect their own interests.

Clemenceau was particularly harsh. France had been invaded, suffered enormous casualties, and wanted revenge. "America is far away, protected by the ocean," Clemenceau said. "We are next to Germany. We want security."

The Treaty of Versailles, signed June 28, 1919, reflected this tension between Wilson's idealism and European vengeanc e.

The treaty forced Germany to:
• Accept full responsibility for causing the war (the "war guilt" clause)
• Pay massive reparations, $33 billion in damages
• Lose all colonies and 13% of European territory
• Limit its army to 100,000 men with no tanks, aircraft, or submarines
• Demilitarize the Rhineland

These terms were intentionally punishing. Germany wasn't even allowed to participate in negotiations, they were presented with the treaty and told to sign it.

The treaty created new nations, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, based on self-determination. But it also created resentments and instabilities that would lead to future conflicts.

Most importantly for Wilson, the treaty established the League of Nations, an international organization where nations could resolve disputes peacefully. Wilson believed the League would correct the treaty's flaws and prevent future wars.

But could he convince the American Senate to accept it?

Chapter Five. Coming Home to a Changed Nation.

The Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles and refused to join the League of Nations. Wilson toured the country promoting the treaty, but suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed. Without his leadership, the treaty died.

Many senators feared the League would entangle America in foreign conflicts. Article X required members to defend each other against aggression. Senators argued this surrendered American sovereignty to an international body. Americans had just fought a war in Europe. Now we wanted to return to our own affairs.

So America never joined the League of Nations, the organization Wilson created. Without American participation, the League lacked power to prevent future conflicts. Wilson's dream of collective security died.

I returned home to Nebraska in January 1919. My hometown welcomed us with parades and celebrations. But I felt disconnected. Civilians celebrated our victory. We remembered the horror.

I can't explain what I saw to people who weren't there. How do you describe watching friends die? Living in trenches? Going over the top knowing you might die in the next minute? The war changed us in ways civilians can't understand.

Many veterans struggled to readjust. Some couldn't hold jobs, plagued by what they'd seen. Others drank to forget. We didn't have words like "PTSD" then, but we knew the war had damaged us psychologically, not just physically.

America changed too. The war expanded federal power dramatically. The government drafted soldiers, controlled industries, restricted speech, encouraged conformity. Women worked in factories, earning money and independence. Black Americans migrated north seeking industrial jobs, beginning the Great Migration. The war accelerated social changes already underway.

Looking back, I see the war's failures. It didn't end all wars, it planted seeds for World War the Second. The harsh treaty terms created German resentment that Hitler would exploit. The League failed without American participation. Millions died for territorial gains that lasted barely twenty years.

But the war also showed American power on the world stage. We helped defeat Germany. We proposed principles for international peace. We demonstrated that oceans no longer isolated us from world affairs. America emerged from World War I as a major world power, though we didn't fully accept that role until World War the Second forced us to.

I'm twenty-one now, a veteran of the Great War. I survived when many didn't. I saw the worst humanity can do, industrial slaughter in muddy trenches. I also saw courage, sacrifice, and solidarity among soldiers who protected each other.

The war taught me that peace isn't natural or automatic. It requires work, wisdom, and willingness to address conflicts before they explode into violence. Wilson understood this. His Fourteen Points and League of Nations represented humanity's hope to prevent future wars through cooperation rather than force.

We failed his vision. The League collapsed. Another world war came. But the dream didn't die. After World War the Second, we'd try again with the United Nations. Maybe someday we'll learn to resolve conflicts without sending young men to die in trenches.

For now, I'm home, trying to build a normal life, carrying memories I'll never escape. The Great War is over. But for those of us who fought it, the war will never truly end.

This concludes today's lesson. World War I. Thank you for listening.
