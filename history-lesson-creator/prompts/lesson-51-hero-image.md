## 🎨 ChatGPT DALL-E 3 Prompt

Create a powerful and historically accurate presidential portrait of Theodore Roosevelt in 1905, during the height of his Progressive Era presidency. Show him as a vigorous man of 47 with his unmistakable round wire-rimmed spectacles and prominent walrus mustache that became his trademark. He wears an impeccably tailored dark three-piece suit typical of early 20th century presidential fashion, with a gold watch chain visible across his vest.

Position him in his White House presidential office, standing beside his mahogany desk which is scattered with documents about his trust-busting legislation and conservation initiatives—visual symbols of his Square Deal policies. Behind him, tall windows reveal the White House grounds he worked to preserve, and bookshelves line the walls filled with leather-bound volumes reflecting his intellectual nature. The American flag stands proudly nearby.

His expression should capture his unique combination of strength and optimism—the man who said "speak softly and carry a big stick" but also championed the common American. The lighting should be warm and golden, reminiscent of formal early 1900s presidential photography, creating a dignified yet approachable atmosphere.

Style this as a formal presidential portrait in the manner of early 20th century photography, with subtle sepia tones that evoke the historical period. Include fine details that students can examine: the texture of his suit, the presidential seal, period-accurate furniture and decor. This image will serve as the hero image for a 7th grade American history lesson, so it should be both visually engaging and rich with historical details that support learning about the Progressive Era and TR's transformative presidency.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language explanation allows complex composition
- Educational context specified for DALL-E's understanding
- Multiple layers of meaning (visual symbols of policies)
- Detailed description for the platform's ability to handle complexity

## 📋 Generation Tips

**For best results:**
1. **Aspect Ratio:** Use 3:1 landscape (1200x400) for hero image, or 16:9 for more standard portrait
2. **Style Variations:** Try "sepia photograph," "oil painting in John Singer Sargent style," or "formal presidential portrait"
3. **Lighting Options:** "Golden hour lighting," "dramatic studio lighting," or "natural window light"
4. **If too formal:** Add "but with TR's characteristic energy and dynamism" to any prompt

**Historical Accuracy Notes:**
- TR's glasses: Round, wire-rimmed (not modern frames)
- Mustache: Thick "walrus" style, very characteristic
- Age in 1905: 47 years old (important for portrait accuracy)
- Presidential Office: The famous Oval Office wasn't built until 1909 (Taft's presidency); TR used a different presidential office in the White House
- Clothing: Three-piece suits were standard, no tuxedos during day
- References: Check Library of Congress for actual TR photos for verification

**Educational Use:**
- **Discussion Questions:**
  - What do TR's glasses and suit tell us about his social class?
  - How does the office setting reflect presidential power?
  - What symbols in the image represent his policies?
- **Learning Objectives:**
  - Recognize TR's distinctive appearance
  - Understand Progressive Era context
