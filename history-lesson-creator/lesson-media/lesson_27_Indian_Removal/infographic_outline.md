**Subtitle:** The Trail of Tears (1830-1838)

**Time Period:** 1830-1838

## Sections

### 1. Our Cherokee Life
I'm Sarah, fourteen years old, Cherokee. My people have lived in these Georgia mountains for generations—longer than anyone can remember. We're not the "savages" white people imagine.

### 2. The Indian Removal Act
In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. President Jackson claims it's voluntary—tribes can choose to move west of the Mississippi to "Indian Territory" in exchange for their eastern lands. But everyone knows the truth: refuse, and you'll be forced out anyway.

### 3. Soldiers Come
Spring 1838. Soldiers arrive with guns and bayonets. General Winfield Scott commands 7,000 troops to round up Cherokee and force us west.

### 4. The Trail Where We Cried
October 1838. We begin the thousand-mile march to Oklahoma. Over 16,000 Cherokee forced west in groups.

### 5. Oklahoma and After
We reached Indian Territory in March 1839. Of 16,000 who started, only about 12,000 arrived. Over 4,000 dead—a quarter of our people.
