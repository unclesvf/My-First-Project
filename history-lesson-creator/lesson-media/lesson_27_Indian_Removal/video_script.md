## Chapter 1: Our Cherokee Life
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Sarah, fourteen years old, Cherokee. My people have lived in these Georgia mountains for generations—longer than anyone can remember. We're not the "savages" white people imagine. We have farms, schools, a written language created by Sequoyah, our own newspaper.

## Chapter 2: The Indian Removal Act
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. President Jackson claims it's voluntary—tribes can choose to move west of the Mississippi to "Indian Territory" in exchange for their eastern lands. But everyone knows the truth: refuse, and you'll be forced out anyway. Jackson argues removal benefits us.
