## Chapter 1: A Merchant's Life

My name is James, and I am fifteen years old. My father is a captain of a merchant ship that sails the Atlantic trade routes. I've been on three voyages with him, learning the merchant's trade and keeping the ship's ledgers.

Our ship is part of what people call the "triangular trade"—though it's not always a perfect triangle. We carry goods between the American colonies, the Caribbean, Africa, and England. Each leg of the journey carries different cargo, and each port brings profit.

Father owns a share of the ship with two other Boston merchants. They invest in the cargo we carry: rum, lumber, dried fish, iron goods. The profits from these voyages have made our family wealthy. We live in a fine brick house on the harbor, and I'll inherit the business one day.

But I've learned that not all trade is honorable. Some of our fellow merchants participate in the slave trade—the most profitable and most terrible branch of Atlantic commerce. Father refuses to carry human cargo, but he trades with those who do. I'm beginning to understand that in this interconnected world of trade, no one's hands are entirely clean.

## Chapter 2: The Colonial Economy

The thirteen colonies produce different goods based on their climate and resources. New England, where we live, has rocky soil but excellent harbors. We build ships, catch fish, and produce rum from West Indian molasses. We're merchants and craftsmen more than farmers.

The Middle Colonies—New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey—are the "bread basket." They export wheat, flour, and grain to the Caribbean islands and southern Europe. Their fertile soil and moderate climate make them ideal for farming.

The Southern colonies grow cash crops for export: tobacco in Virginia and Maryland, rice in the Carolinas. These labor-intensive crops rely increasingly on enslaved African workers. The plantation owners grow rich, but at a terrible human cost.

The Caribbean islands grow sugar—the most profitable crop in the Atlantic world. Sugar production is brutal work done by enslaved Africans who die in shocking numbers from exhaustion, disease, and abuse. Yet the demand for sugar in Europe seems endless, driving the whole vicious system.

## Chapter 3: Navigation Acts and Mercantilism

England controls colonial trade through the Navigation Acts. These laws say we can only trade certain goods with England or other English colonies. We must use English ships with English crews. Valuable goods like tobacco and sugar must go to England first, even if they're destined for other countries.

This is part of mercantilism—the idea that colonies exist to enrich the mother country. We're supposed to provide raw materials to England and buy manufactured goods from them. We're not supposed to manufacture our own finished products or trade freely with other nations.

Many colonists resent these restrictions. Father says the Navigation Acts cost us money—we could get better prices selling directly to France or Spain. Some merchants turn to smuggling, secretly trading with the French Caribbean islands or hiding cargo from English customs officials.

But Father obeys the law, even when it costs us profit. "We're still Englishmen," he says. "These trade routes have made us prosperous, even with their restrictions. Someday, these rules may change. Until then, we work within them." I wonder if he's right, or if the conflict between colonial economic interests and English control will grow worse.

## Chapter 4: The Human Cost

Last year, we were in port in Charleston when a slave ship arrived from Africa. I watched from the dock as the enslaved people were brought up from the hold—thin, sick, traumatized. The smell was unbearable. Many had died during the Middle Passage, their bodies thrown overboard like cargo.

The survivors were sold at auction. Families were separated. Children torn from mothers. People sold to different plantation owners, never to see each other again. The auctioneer spoke of them like livestock, examining their teeth and muscles, pricing them based on their ability to work.

That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the sugar in our tea, the tobacco we ship, the molasses we buy to make rum. Our prosperity—all of colonial prosperity—is built on this system. The triangle connects us all: European manufactured goods, African lives, American resources, Caribbean sugar.

Father says some Quakers in Philadelphia are speaking out against slavery, calling it evil and unchristian. But their voices are few. Most people find slavery too profitable to question. I fear that we're building an economy that will require a terrible reckoning someday. The human cost of our prosperity is too high, but we've built our whole world upon it.

## Chapter 5: Breaking the Chain

I've made a decision that Father doesn't fully understand. When I inherit the business, I will not trade in goods produced by enslaved labor. No sugar, no tobacco, no rice, no indigo. I know this will cost us profit—these are the most valuable commodities in Atlantic trade.

Father says I'm being impractical, that one merchant's conscience won't change the system. "You'll just make yourself poor while others grow rich," he warns. Perhaps he's right. But I've seen too much to continue participating, even indirectly, in human misery.

I've been reading pamphlets by Quaker abolitionists who argue that slavery violates Christian principles and natural rights. If all men are created equal, as they say, then slavery is an abomination. The economic argument—that colonies need slavery to prosper—is a lie we tell ourselves to avoid confronting moral truth.

I'm young, and my protest is small. But I believe the triangular trade's days are numbered. The contradiction is too great—English colonists who fled oppression now oppress others; Christians who preach love practice cruelty; merchants who prize liberty deny it to hundreds of thousands. Something will have to give. I don't know when or how, but I believe future generations will look back on this system with horror and shame. I want to be able to say I stood against it, even when standing against it cost me.

**Navigation Acts:** English laws controlling colonial trade, requiring colonists to trade certain goods only with England and use English ships.

**Cash Crop:** Crops grown primarily for sale and profit rather than personal use, such as tobacco, rice, and sugar. Indigo would later become another important cash crop in the 1740s.

**Middle Passage:** The brutal ocean voyage that forcibly transported enslaved Africans to the Americas, part of the triangular trade system.

**Smuggling:** Illegal trade that violated the Navigation Acts, often conducted with French or Spanish colonies to avoid English restrictions.

**Raw Materials:** Natural resources like lumber, fish, tobacco, and rice that colonies exported to England for manufacturing.

**Molasses:** A thick syrup produced from sugar cane, imported from the Caribbean and used in New England to make rum.

**Colonial Economy:** Economic system where different colonial regions specialized in producing specific goods based on their climate, resources, and labor systems for Atlantic trade networks.

**Customs Officials:** English government agents who enforced the Navigation Acts by inspecting ships, collecting duties, and preventing illegal trade between colonists and foreign nations.
