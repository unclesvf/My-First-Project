**Subtitle:** Colonial Economy and Atlantic Trade (1650-1750)

**Time Period:** 1650-1750

## Sections

### 1. A Merchant's Life
My name is James, and I am fifteen years old. My father is a captain of a merchant ship that sails the Atlantic trade routes. I've been on three voyages with him, learning the merchant's trade and keeping the ship's ledgers.

### 2. The Colonial Economy
The thirteen colonies produce different goods based on their climate and resources. New England, where we live, has rocky soil but excellent harbors. We build ships, catch fish, and produce rum from West Indian molasses.

### 3. Navigation Acts and Mercantilism
England controls colonial trade through the Navigation Acts. These laws say we can only trade certain goods with England or other English colonies. We must use English ships with English crews.

### 4. The Human Cost
Last year, we were in port in Charleston when a slave ship arrived from Africa. I watched from the dock as the enslaved people were brought up from the hold—thin, sick, traumatized. The smell was unbearable.

### 5. Breaking the Chain
I've made a decision that Father doesn't fully understand. When I inherit the business, I will not trade in goods produced by enslaved labor. No sugar, no tobacco, no rice, no indigo.
