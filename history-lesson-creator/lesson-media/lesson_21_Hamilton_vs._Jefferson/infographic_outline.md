# Infographic Outline: Hamilton vs. Jefferson

**Subtitle:** Federalists vs. Democratic-Republicans (1790s)

**Time Period:** 1790s

## Sections

### 1. Two Visions
I'm Samuel, fifteen, and I'm learning that America has two completely different visions for its future. Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson can't agree on anything, and their disagreements are splitting the nation. Hamilton wants America to become like Britain: urban, industrial, commercial.

### 2. Political Parties Form
Hamilton's supporters call themselves Federalists. They're mostly merchants, bankers, manufacturers, and wealthy landowners from cities and northern states. They want a strong, active federal government.

### 3. The Newspaper Wars
The party battle plays out in newspapers. Hamilton secretly funds the Gazette of the United States, edited by John Fenno, which publishes Federalist views. Jefferson supports the National Gazette, edited by Philip Freneau, which attacks Federalist policies.

### 4. Foreign Policy Divides Us
The French Revolution makes our divisions worse. In 1789, France overthrew its monarchy, claiming to follow America's example. Jefferson and his supporters celebrate—France is becoming a republic!

### 5. The Election of 1796
When Washington retires, the first true partisan presidential election happens in 1796. Federalist John Adams runs against Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson. There are no national campaigns—the candidates don't travel or give speeches.

### 6. What Political Parties Mean
The Founders hoped we wouldn't have political parties. Washington warned against them in his Farewell Address. They feared parties would put faction above country, loyalty to party above loyalty to nation.
