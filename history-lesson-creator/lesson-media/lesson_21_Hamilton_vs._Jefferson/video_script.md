## Chapter 1: Two Visions
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Samuel, fifteen, and I'm learning that America has two completely different visions for its future. Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson can't agree on anything, and their disagreements are splitting the nation. Hamilton wants America to become like Britain: urban, industrial, commercial. He supports a strong federal government, a national bank, tariffs to protect manufacturers, and close ties with Britain.

**Narration:**
Hamilton's supporters call themselves Federalists. They're mostly merchants, bankers, manufacturers, and wealthy landowners from cities and northern states.

## Chapter 3: The Newspaper Wars
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The party battle plays out in newspapers. Hamilton secretly funds the Gazette of the United States, edited by John Fenno, which publishes Federalist views. Jefferson supports the National Gazette, edited by Philip Freneau, which attacks Federalist policies. The papers don't just disagree—they attack viciously.

## Chapter 6: What Political Parties Mean
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The Founders hoped we wouldn't have political parties. Washington warned against them in his Farewell Address. They feared parties would put faction above country, loyalty to party above loyalty to nation. But parties emerged anyway because Americans genuinely disagree about fundamental questions: Should the federal government be strong or limited?
