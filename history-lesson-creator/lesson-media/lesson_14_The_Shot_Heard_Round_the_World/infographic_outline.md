## Sections

### 1. The Midnight Ride
My name is Nathan, and I am seventeen years old. I'm a Minuteman—part of our militia trained to be ready at a minute's notice. Tonight, April 18, 1775, that training will be tested.

### 2. Lexington Green
At dawn in Lexington, Captain John Parker lined up about 70 militiamen on the town green. They could hear the British approaching—marching feet, rattling equipment, officers shouting commands. The British force was ten times their size.

### 3. The Battle of Concord
By the time the British reached Concord, we'd assembled hundreds of militiamen. We watched from a ridge as British soldiers searched the town for weapons and supplies. We'd hidden most of it, but they found some and started burning it.

### 4. No Turning Back
Tonight, I'm home, exhausted and shaken. I fired my musket at British soldiers today. British soldiers fired at me.

### 5. The Weight of Choice
Three days have passed. The reality of what we've done settles over me like a heavy cloak. I attended the funeral of Isaac Davis, our militia captain, killed at North Bridge.
