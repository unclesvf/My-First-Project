# The Boston Tea Party

**Description:** Colonial Resistance Escalates (1773)

## Chapter 1: The Tea Act

My name is Thomas, and I am fifteen years old. I work as an apprentice carpenter in Boston, but tonight I'm about to become part of history. Parliament has passed the Tea Act, giving the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies. This will drive colonial tea merchants out of business and force us to buy British tea—with a tax attached.

Many colonists see this as a trick. Britain is trying to get us to accept Parliamentary taxation by making the tea cheap. If we buy the taxed tea, we're admitting Parliament has the right to tax us. "It's the principle," my master says. "Once we accept one tax, they'll tax everything."

Three ships carrying East India Company tea have arrived in Boston Harbor: the Dartmouth, the Eleanor, and the Beaver. Governor Hutchinson won't let them leave without unloading their cargo. Samuel Adams and the Sons of Liberty won't let the tea be unloaded. We're at a standoff.

Tonight, December 16, 1773, a huge crowd has gathered at Old South Meeting House. I'm here with my master, listening to speeches about liberty and tyranny. Samuel Adams says, "This meeting can do nothing more to save the country." It's a signal. We all know what happens next.

## Chapter 2: The Destruction of the Tea

Outside the meeting house, I see men disguising themselves as Mohawk Indians—a thin disguise of blankets, face paint, and feathers. It's meant to hide our identities and perhaps to symbolize that we're Americans, not British. I join them. My heart races with excitement and fear.

We march to Griffin's Wharf where the ships are docked. There are about 150 of us. We board the ships in organized groups. The captains and crew don't resist—this is between us and the British government, not them.

For three hours, we work systematically. We break open 342 chests of tea with axes and hatchets. We dump the tea into Boston Harbor. The smell of tea fills the air. We damage nothing else—this is a protest against the tax, not theft or vandalism. When we're done, we sweep the decks clean.

The next morning, Boston Harbor is a giant tea pot. The destroyed tea is worth £10,000—a fortune. We've made our point: we will not accept taxation without representation, not even for cheap tea. Britain will have to respond, and I fear what that response will be.

## Chapter 3: The Intolerable Acts

Britain's response is swift and harsh. Parliament passes laws we call the Intolerable Acts. The Boston Port Act closes Boston Harbor until we pay for the tea—shutting down our economy. The Massachusetts Government Act strips away our charter and self-government. British officials accused of crimes will be tried in Britain, not here. We must quarter soldiers in our homes if needed.

These laws aren't just punishing Boston—they're attacking the fundamental rights of all Massachusetts colonists. Britain is showing its power, trying to make an example of us to frighten other colonies into submission.

But the Intolerable Acts backfire. Instead of isolating Boston, they unite the colonies. The other colonies send food and supplies to help us survive the blockade. They see that what Britain does to Massachusetts, it could do to any colony. Our resistance has become their resistance.

Plans are being made for a Continental Congress—representatives from all thirteen colonies meeting to coordinate a response to British tyranny. The Boston Tea Party wasn't just about tea. It was about whether we would submit to British authority or stand up for our rights. We chose to stand up, and now there's no turning back.

## Chapter 4: Colonial Unity Emerges

In September 1774, representatives from twelve colonies (all except Georgia) met in Philadelphia for the First Continental Congress. This was extraordinary—never before had the colonies united like this. Each colony had always looked after its own interests. But now we realized that an attack on one colony was an attack on all.

The Congress debated how to respond to British tyranny. Some wanted immediate armed resistance. Others hoped for reconciliation with Britain. They settled on a middle course: a complete boycott of British goods until the Intolerable Acts were repealed, and a declaration of colonial rights.

They also formed the Continental Association to enforce the boycott. Committees of Correspondence spread throughout the colonies, sharing information and coordinating resistance. We were no longer thirteen separate colonies—we were becoming a united American people.

My master attended meetings of Boston's Committee of Correspondence. He came home energized by the sense of possibility. "For the first time," he said, "we're acting as one. If Britain tries to divide us, they'll fail. We're stronger together than they realize." The Tea Party had achieved more than destroying tea—it had united us in common cause.

## Chapter 5: The Point of No Return

Looking back now, I see that December night in 1773 as the point of no return. We'd protested before—boycotts, petitions, demonstrations. But dumping the tea was different. We'd destroyed British property worth a fortune. We'd directly defied British authority. There was no way to undo it, no way to apologize our way out of it.

Britain had to respond with force, or lose all authority over the colonies. The Intolerable Acts weren't a mistake or an overreaction—they were inevitable. And our unified resistance to those acts was equally inevitable. We'd crossed a line from protest to open defiance.

I remember the excitement I felt that night, breaking open the tea chests. I felt like I was striking a blow for liberty. But in the months that followed, as Boston suffered under the blockade, as tensions mounted, as we prepared for possible war, I came to understand what that blow would cost.

My master says we're on a path to independence now, though few dare speak the word aloud. We've discovered that we can stand together against Britain. We've learned that we value our rights more than we value peace. And we've proven we're willing to fight for those rights. The tea floating in Boston Harbor was a symbol—a symbol that we would rather destroy our relationship with Britain than submit to tyranny. Within two years, we'd be at war. The Tea Party was the spark that lit the fuse.
