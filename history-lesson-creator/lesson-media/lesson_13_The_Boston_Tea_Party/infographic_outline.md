# Infographic Outline: The Boston Tea Party

**Subtitle:** Colonial Resistance Escalates (1773)

**Time Period:** 1773

## Sections

### 1. The Tea Act
My name is Thomas, and I am fifteen years old. I work as an apprentice carpenter in Boston, but tonight I'm about to become part of history. Parliament has passed the Tea Act, giving the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies.

### 2. The Destruction of the Tea
Outside the meeting house, I see men disguising themselves as Mohawk Indians—a thin disguise of blankets, face paint, and feathers. It's meant to hide our identities and perhaps to symbolize that we're Americans, not British. I join them.

### 3. The Intolerable Acts
Britain's response is swift and harsh. Parliament passes laws we call the Intolerable Acts. The Boston Port Act closes Boston Harbor until we pay for the tea—shutting down our economy.

### 4. Colonial Unity Emerges
In September 1774, representatives from twelve colonies (all except Georgia) met in Philadelphia for the First Continental Congress. This was extraordinary—never before had the colonies united like this. Each colony had always looked after its own interests.

### 5. The Point of No Return
Looking back now, I see that December night in 1773 as the point of no return. We'd protested before—boycotts, petitions, demonstrations. But dumping the tea was different.
