## Chapter 2: No Rights That White Men Must Respect
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Chief Justice Taney's opinion was read in the courtroom. The words spread through the free Black community like fire. I heard them from my father, who heard them from a lawyer friend. Taney ruled that Black people—whether enslaved or free—are not citizens of the United States.

## Chapter 3: The Missouri Compromise Struck Down
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Taney's opinion went further than just denying Dred Scott's freedom and Black citizenship. He struck down the Missouri Compromise, the law that had regulated slavery in the territories for 37 years. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 banned slavery north of the 36°30' line in the Louisiana Territory. It was a carefully crafted compromise that had kept peace for decades.

## Chapter 4: Sectional Crisis Deepens
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The reaction to the Dred Scott decision splits along sectional lines, making the national divide even worse. Southerners celebrate. Finally, they say, the Supreme Court has recognized their rights. Slavery is constitutional.

## Chapter 5: The Path to War
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Four years after the Dred Scott decision, the Civil War begins. I'm twenty now, watching the nation tear itself apart over the question the Supreme Court tried to settle. Looking back, I see how the decision made war more likely. Before Dred Scott, there were potential compromises: ban slavery in some territories, allow it in others; admit states in pairs (one free, one slave); enforce the Fugitive Slave Act while limiting slavery's expansion.
