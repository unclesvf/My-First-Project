## Chapter 1: Dred Scott's Long Battle

I'm Frederick, sixteen years old, and I'm free. My father was born enslaved but bought his freedom and moved our family to Pennsylvania, a free state. We have our own home, our own business. We're free—or so I thought.

Today, March 6, 1857, the Supreme Court announced its decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford. We've been following this case for years, hoping for justice. Dred Scott was enslaved in Missouri. His owner, an army surgeon, took him to Illinois (a free state) and then to Wisconsin Territory (free under the Missouri Compromise). Scott lived in free territory for years, married there, had children there.

When they returned to Missouri, Scott's owner died. Scott sued for his freedom, arguing that living in free territory had made him free. It seemed like a clear case: if you live as a free man in free territory, you should be free.

The case went through Missouri courts, then federal courts, finally reaching the Supreme Court. The free Black community watched anxiously. If Scott won, it would establish that enslaved people who entered free territory became free. It would be a major victory for freedom.

We should have known better than to hope. The Supreme Court has nine justices. Five are from slave states. Chief Justice Roger Taney is from Maryland, a state that depends on slavery. President Buchanan, who just took office, pressured justices to settle the slavery question once and for all.

Today we learned the result. And it's worse than we imagined.

## Chapter 2: No Rights That White Men Must Respect

Chief Justice Taney's opinion was read in the courtroom. The words spread through the free Black community like fire. I heard them from my father, who heard them from a lawyer friend.

Taney ruled that Black people—whether enslaved or free—are not citizens of the United States. We cannot sue in federal court. We have no standing before the law.

Then came the most devastating sentence: Black people "had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect."

No rights which the white man was bound to respect.

I am sixteen years old. I was born free in Pennsylvania. My father worked for years to earn his freedom and build a life for us. We pay taxes. We obey laws. We contribute to our community. And the highest court in the land says we have no rights that white men must respect.

The ruling doesn't just deny Dred Scott his freedom—it denies my humanity. It says that my family, despite living in a free state, could be kidnapped and enslaved, and we'd have no legal recourse. We're not citizens. We're not even fully human in the eyes of the law.

Mother cried when she heard. Father was silent, his jaw clenched. My younger sister asked, "Does this mean we're not free anymore?" I didn't know how to answer.

The Dred Scott decision tells us that America—with all its talk of liberty and equality—doesn't include us. We're outsiders in the country where we were born.

## Chapter 3: The Missouri Compromise Struck Down

Taney's opinion went further than just denying Dred Scott's freedom and Black citizenship. He struck down the Missouri Compromise, the law that had regulated slavery in the territories for 37 years.

The Missouri Compromise of 1820 banned slavery north of the 36°30' line in the Louisiana Territory. It was a carefully crafted compromise that had kept peace for decades. But Taney ruled it unconstitutional.

His reasoning: Congress has no power to ban slavery in the territories. Enslaved people are property, protected by the Fifth Amendment, which says property cannot be taken without due process. Banning slavery in territories would deprive slaveholders of their property rights.

Think about the implications. If Congress can't ban slavery in territories, then slavery can expand anywhere. The Republican Party's entire platform—stopping slavery's expansion—is unconstitutional according to the Supreme Court.

Popular sovereignty is also undermined. If slaveholders have a constitutional right to bring enslaved people into any territory, how can territorial legislatures vote to ban slavery? The Supreme Court has essentially said slavery must be allowed everywhere.

Free states like Pennsylvania are theoretically still free, but even that feels uncertain. If enslaved people are property, and property rights are protected by the Constitution, couldn't a slaveholder bring enslaved people into Pennsylvania and claim constitutional protection? The logic of Taney's decision could theoretically nationalize slavery.

Northerners are outraged. The Chicago Tribune writes: "The Constitution is now what the Supreme Court says it is, not what the People say it is." The New York Tribune calls it a "wicked and false judgment."

But it's the law of the land. And we have no recourse except to change the Court—which requires electing a president who will appoint different justices. But how long will that take?

## Chapter 4: Sectional Crisis Deepens

The reaction to the Dred Scott decision splits along sectional lines, making the national divide even worse.

Southerners celebrate. Finally, they say, the Supreme Court has recognized their rights. Slavery is constitutional. It can't be banned in territories. The Republican Party's platform is unconstitutional. Southern newspapers call it a great victory for constitutional law.

Some Southern politicians take it further. Senator Albert Brown of Mississippi says if slavery is constitutionally protected in territories, it must be protected in states too. He proposes a federal slave code to enforce slavery everywhere. Other Southerners talk about reopening the African slave trade, banned since 1808.

Northerners are furious. Republicans call the decision illegitimate, a political ruling rather than a legal one. They point out that Taney could have ruled narrowly—just deciding that Scott, as a non-citizen, couldn't sue in federal court. Instead, he issued a sweeping opinion about slavery in the territories, going beyond what the case required.

Abraham Lincoln, a Republican lawyer from Illinois, says the decision is wrongly decided and not binding as a permanent precedent. He argues that if Republicans win the presidency, they can effectively ignore the decision by appointing new justices who will overturn it.

This is extraordinary: a major political party vowing to defy a Supreme Court decision. It shows how completely the constitutional system is breaking down. The Court was supposed to be the final arbiter, the institution that settles disputes peacefully. Now its rulings are rejected by half the country.

The free Black community is devastated but not surprised. We've always known that American law didn't protect us equally. But having it stated so explicitly by the Supreme Court is a blow. Some free Black families consider emigrating to Canada or Liberia, despairing of ever achieving equality in America.

The Dred Scott decision doesn't resolve the slavery crisis. It deepens it. It radicalizes both sides and eliminates the middle ground.

## Chapter 5: The Path to War

Four years after the Dred Scott decision, the Civil War begins. I'm twenty now, watching the nation tear itself apart over the question the Supreme Court tried to settle.

Looking back, I see how the decision made war more likely. Before Dred Scott, there were potential compromises: ban slavery in some territories, allow it in others; admit states in pairs (one free, one slave); enforce the Fugitive Slave Act while limiting slavery's expansion.

After Dred Scott, these compromises seemed impossible. The Court had ruled that any restriction on slavery was unconstitutional. But Republicans, who won a majority in the North, refused to accept this. They campaigned explicitly on stopping slavery's expansion, directly contradicting the Supreme Court.

In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected president without winning a single Southern state. His election showed that the North would never accept the Dred Scott decision. Southern states, believing their constitutional rights would not be protected, began seceding.

The irony is bitter: Taney thought his decision would settle the slavery question and preserve the Union. Instead, it hastened the Union's dissolution. By denying any middle ground, by declaring slavery constitutionally protected everywhere, he made peaceful coexistence impossible.

Dred Scott himself was freed shortly after the decision—his owner emancipated him. He died a free man in 1858, just months after the Supreme Court said he had no rights. His widow and daughters lived to see the Thirteenth Amendment abolish slavery in 1865, overturning Taney's ruling.

I think about that phrase often: "No rights which the white man was bound to respect." It still stings. But the Civil War and the constitutional amendments that followed proved Taney wrong. We do have rights. We are citizens. We are human beings entitled to dignity, equality, and justice.

The Dred Scott decision was the Supreme Court's greatest failure—a stain on American law that took a war and constitutional amendments to erase. It taught a painful lesson: courts can't save a nation from itself. When fundamental moral questions divide a people, legal decisions won't resolve them. Only the people themselves, through struggle and sacrifice, can build a more just society.

Taney died in 1864, with the Union he tried to preserve broken by war and the slavery system he tried to protect crumbling. History has judged him harshly, and rightly so. The Dred Scott decision stands as a warning: law without justice is tyranny, and courts that protect oppression betray their purpose.
