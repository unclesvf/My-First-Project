# Infographic Outline: Dred Scott Decision

**Subtitle:** The Supreme Court Fails (1857)

**Time Period:** 1857

## Sections

### 1. Dred Scott's Long Battle
I'm Frederick, sixteen years old, and I'm free. My father was born enslaved but bought his freedom and moved our family to Pennsylvania, a free state. We have our own home, our own business.

### 2. No Rights That White Men Must Respect
Chief Justice Taney's opinion was read in the courtroom. The words spread through the free Black community like fire. I heard them from my father, who heard them from a lawyer friend.

### 3. The Missouri Compromise Struck Down
Taney's opinion went further than just denying Dred Scott's freedom and Black citizenship. He struck down the Missouri Compromise, the law that had regulated slavery in the territories for 37 years. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 banned slavery north of the 36°30' line in the Louisiana Territory.

### 4. Sectional Crisis Deepens
The reaction to the Dred Scott decision splits along sectional lines, making the national divide even worse. Southerners celebrate. Finally, they say, the Supreme Court has recognized their rights.

### 5. The Path to War
Four years after the Dred Scott decision, the Civil War begins. I'm twenty now, watching the nation tear itself apart over the question the Supreme Court tried to settle. Looking back, I see how the decision made war more likely.
