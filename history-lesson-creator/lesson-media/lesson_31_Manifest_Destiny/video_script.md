## Chapter 1: Oregon Trail
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Samuel, sixteen, and our family has been on the Oregon Trail for six months. We left Independence, Missouri in the spring of 1846 with everything we owned packed into a covered wagon. Two thousand miles of prairie, mountains, rivers, and desert separate us from Oregon's Willamette Valley. The journey is harder than anyone imagined.

## Chapter 2: Whose Land?
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
But the land isn't empty. We've passed through territories of the Pawnee, Sioux, Shoshone, and dozens of other Native nations. They watch our wagon trains from hills, sometimes trading with us, sometimes just observing. We're crossing their homeland without permission, hunting their buffalo, using their water, cutting their trees for firewood.
