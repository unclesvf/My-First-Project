# Infographic Outline: Manifest Destiny

**Subtitle:** Westward Expansion (1840s)

**Time Period:** 1840s

## Sections

### 1. Oregon Trail
I'm Samuel, sixteen, and our family has been on the Oregon Trail for six months. We left Independence, Missouri in the spring of 1846 with everything we owned packed into a covered wagon. Two thousand miles of prairie, mountains, rivers, and desert separate us from Oregon's Willamette Valley.

### 2. Whose Land?
But the land isn't empty. We've passed through territories of the Pawnee, Sioux, Shoshone, and dozens of other Native nations. They watch our wagon trains from hills, sometimes trading with us, sometimes just observing.

### 3. 54-40 or Fight
Oregon itself is disputed territory. Britain and America both claim it through competing treaties and exploration. The boundary hasn't been settled.

### 4. Reaching Oregon
After six months, we finally reach Oregon's Willamette Valley. The land is beautiful—green, fertile, watered by rain. We claim 640 acres under Oregon's provisional land laws.

### 5. The Cost of Destiny
Manifest Destiny has given America vast new territory. Oregon, Texas, and soon California and the Southwest will add millions of acres to the nation. Americans are flooding west, building farms, towns, eventually states.
