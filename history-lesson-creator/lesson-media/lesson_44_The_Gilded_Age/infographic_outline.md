# Infographic Outline: The Gilded Age

**Subtitle:** Industry and Inequality (1870-1900)

**Time Period:** 1870-1900

## Sections

### 1. The Golden Surface
I'm Anna, fifteen years old, and I work in a garment factory in New York City. My family immigrated from Italy two years ago seeking opportunity in America. What we found was hard work, poverty, and inequality—but also a nation transforming before our eyes.

### 2. Life in the Factory
I work twelve hours a day, six days a week in a garment factory making shirtwaists (women's blouses). The factory is on the eighth floor of a building with no fire escapes. Three hundred women and girls work here, crowded together at sewing machines.

### 3. The Titans of Industry
The men who control American industry are sometimes called "Robber Barons"—a term suggesting they stole their fortunes. Others call them "Captains of Industry"—leaders who built America's economy. The truth is complicated.

### 4. Child Labor and Exploitation
The worst aspect of the Gilded Age is child labor. Children as young as six work in mines, factories, and fields instead of attending school. I see it daily in the garment factory where ten-year-old girls work alongside me.

### 5. The Meaning of Progress
The Gilded Age forces us to ask: What is progress? By some measures, America is progressing rapidly. Steel production increases more than one hundred fold between 1870 and 1900.
