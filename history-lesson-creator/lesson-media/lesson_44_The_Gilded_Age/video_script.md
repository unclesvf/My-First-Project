## Chapter 1: The Golden Surface
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Anna, fifteen years old, and I work in a garment factory in New York City. My family immigrated from Italy two years ago seeking opportunity in America. What we found was hard work, poverty, and inequality—but also a nation transforming before our eyes. This era is called the Gilded Age—a name from Mark Twain's novel.

## Chapter 2: Life in the Factory
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I work twelve hours a day, six days a week in a garment factory making shirtwaists (women's blouses). The factory is on the eighth floor of a building with no fire escapes. Three hundred women and girls work here, crowded together at sewing machines. We arrive at 7 a.m.

## Chapter 3: The Titans of Industry
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The men who control American industry are sometimes called "Robber Barons"—a term suggesting they stole their fortunes. Others call them "Captains of Industry"—leaders who built America's economy. The truth is complicated. Andrew Carnegie is a good example.

## Chapter 4: Child Labor and Exploitation
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The worst aspect of the Gilded Age is child labor. Children as young as six work in mines, factories, and fields instead of attending school. I see it daily in the garment factory where ten-year-old girls work alongside me. In coal mines, young boys work as "breakers"—sitting for twelve hours sorting coal, breathing dust that ruins their lungs.

## Chapter 5: The Meaning of Progress
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The Gilded Age forces us to ask: What is progress? By some measures, America is progressing rapidly. Steel production increases more than one hundred fold between 1870 and 1900. Railroad mileage quadruples.
