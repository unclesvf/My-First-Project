# Radical Reconstruction

**Description:** Congressional Control (1867-1870)

## Chapter 1: Congress Takes Control

I'm Eliza, sixteen years old, and I live in South Carolina. I was born enslaved but freed when I was thirteen, after the Civil War ended. The past three years have been chaotic—freedom without resources, Black Codes restricting our rights, President Johnson allowing former Confederates back into power.

But in March 1867, everything changed. Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts over President Johnson's veto. They took control of Reconstruction away from the President.

The Acts divided the former Confederacy into five military districts, each governed by a Union general. These generals have power to protect our rights and maintain order. Southern states must write new constitutions guaranteeing Black male suffrage—the right to vote. States must ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, making us citizens with equal protection under law. Only after meeting these requirements can states rejoin the Union.

It's radical—the federal government forcing states to guarantee Black voting rights. But it's also necessary. Presidential Reconstruction failed. Former slaveholders passed Black Codes and used violence to restore white supremacy. Only federal military power can protect our freedom.

In South Carolina, General Daniel Sickles is military governor. He invalidates the Black Codes, protects Black people's rights to testify in court, and ensures fair treatment. It's the first time in my life I've felt protected by law rather than threatened by it.

Most important: Black men can vote. My father registered to vote in 1867. He was almost fifty years old and had been enslaved his entire life. Now he's a voter with the power to choose representatives.

"I never thought I'd see this day," he said, showing me his voter registration certificate. "Free and a citizen with the right to vote." He cried—tears of joy and disbelief that freedom could mean this much.

## Chapter 2: Constitutional Conventions

Early 1868. South Carolina holds a constitutional convention to write a new state constitution. For the first time, Black men participate in government. Of 124 delegates, 76 are Black—a majority. Most were enslaved just two years ago.

I attend the convention's opening session in Charleston. The convention hall is packed—Black and white delegates, spectators, journalists. It's extraordinary seeing Black men debating law and policy, writing a constitution that will govern all South Carolinians.

The constitution they write is remarkably progressive. It establishes public schools for all children—Black and white—funded by taxes. It protects property rights and civil rights for all citizens. It gives Black men the right to vote and hold office. It's more democratic than the old constitution, which concentrated power in the hands of wealthy white planters.

Some delegates are highly educated—ministers, teachers, skilled craftsmen who were free before the war. Others are recently freed, with little formal education but keen intelligence and determination. Robert Smalls, a former slave who became a Civil War hero by capturing a Confederate ship and delivering it to the Union, is a delegate. So is Francis Cardozo, an educated minister who becomes Secretary of State.

White conservatives are furious. They call the convention "Negro rule" and the delegates ignorant. But the constitution the convention produces is sound, fair, and progressive. Voters ratify it overwhelmingly in 1868.

That same year, South Carolina elects a new legislature under the new constitution. Eighty-seven of 157 legislators are Black. It's the only state legislature in American history with a Black majority.

My father's friend Robert is elected to the state House of Representatives. He'd been a field hand, enslaved his entire life. Now he's a legislator making laws. "We're building a new South," he tells us. "A South based on equality and justice, not slavery and oppression."

## Chapter 3: The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments

The constitutional changes aren't just at the state level. Congress is rewriting the U.S. Constitution to protect Black rights.

The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, makes us citizens. Before, the Dred Scott decision said Black people weren't citizens. The Fourteenth Amendment overturns that, declaring that all persons born in the United States are citizens. It guarantees equal protection under law and due process. States can't deprive citizens of rights without legal process.

This is monumental. Citizenship isn't just symbolic—it means legal standing. We can sue in court, claim constitutional protections, demand equal treatment. The amendment provides the constitutional foundation for civil rights.

The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in 1870, protects voting rights. It declares that the right to vote cannot be denied based on "race, color, or previous condition of servitude." Black men across the country can vote, not just in the South.

I watch as my father and other Black men vote for the first time in 1868. They line up outside the polling place, many wearing their best clothes, treating it as the solemn civic duty it is. White conservatives glare at them, angry that former slaves now have political power. But federal troops are there to protect the voters.

Father votes for Republican candidates—the party of Lincoln, emancipation, and Reconstruction. He's voting for men who will protect his rights and continue building a society based on equality.

That night, when the votes are counted, Republicans sweep the elections. Black men helped elect them. We're not just free—we're political participants with actual power to shape government. It's what freedom should mean: not just absence of slavery but presence of rights and political power.

## Chapter 4: Progress and Achievement

The years 1868-1870 are a time of remarkable progress in South Carolina. Black men serve in the legislature, as sheriffs and judges, as members of Congress. Hiram Revels of Mississippi becomes the first Black U.S. Senator in 1870. Joseph Rainey of South Carolina becomes the first Black member of the House of Representatives. These men prove that Black people can govern effectively.

The Reconstruction governments invest in public education. Before the war, it was illegal to teach enslaved people to read. Now the state builds schools for Black and white children. The Freedmen's Bureau and Northern missionary societies help establish schools across the South.

I'm able to attend school for the first time. I'm sixteen and learning to read alongside younger children. It's humbling but wonderful. Our teacher is a Black woman from the North who came south to teach. She's patient and encouraging.

"Education is freedom," she tells us. "No one can take knowledge from you. Learn to read, and you can educate yourselves forever."

Black communities build churches, mutual aid societies, and political organizations. Churches become centers of community life—not just for worship but for education, political organizing, and mutual support.

We're also building economic independence. Some Black families buy land. Others open businesses. Father saves money working as a carpenter, hoping to buy our own farm someday. We're trying to build a foundation for future generations.

The progress feels fragile but real. For the first time, Black people in the South have legal rights, political power, and opportunities for education and economic advancement. We're building the society that should have existed from America's founding—one based on equality and democracy rather than slavery and racial hierarchy.

## Chapter 5: The Reign of Terror

But white conservatives won't accept this new order. They use violence to restore white supremacy and undo Reconstruction.

The Ku Klux Klan—a terrorist organization of former Confederates—spreads across the South. They wear white robes and hoods to hide their identities. They ride at night, attacking Black people who assert their rights and white Republicans who support Reconstruction.

In 1868, the Klan murders my neighbor, Samuel, a Black man who registered to vote. They dragged him from his home at night, beat him, and hanged him from a tree. His crime: political activism.

They leave his body hanging as a warning to other Black voters. The message is clear: assert your rights and you'll die.

The violence escalates before the 1868 election. The Klan attacks polling places, murders Black voters, burns Black churches and schools. In some areas, they kill dozens of Black people and white Republicans in coordinated campaigns of terror.

Father still votes, but he's frightened. We all are. Every Black person exercising their rights knows they might be the next victim. But many refuse to be intimidated. "They want us to be afraid," Father says. "If we surrender our rights out of fear, freedom means nothing."

Congress passes the Enforcement Acts and the Ku Klux Klan Act, giving the federal government power to protect Black voters and prosecute terrorists. President Grant sends federal troops to suppress the Klan. Hundreds of Klan members are arrested and tried.

For a while, the federal intervention works. Klan violence decreases. We have a few years of relative safety to vote and participate in government.

But we wonder how long it will last. Northern commitment to Reconstruction is wavering. Democrats campaign on ending "Negro rule" and restoring "home rule"—code words for white supremacy. Economic depression in the North makes Reconstruction seem less important. White Northerners who fought to end slavery are losing interest in protecting Black rights.

Reconstruction gave us citizenship, voting rights, and political power. But it didn't give us economic independence or change white Southerners' determination to maintain racial hierarchy. Everything we've gained depends on federal military protection and Northern political will. What happens when those fade?

I'm eighteen now, educated and hopeful but also realistic. We've made extraordinary progress, but it's under siege. The question isn't whether we deserve freedom and equality—we do, obviously. The question is whether America will defend those principles against violent opposition. The answer will determine not just Reconstruction's success but the meaning of American democracy itself.
