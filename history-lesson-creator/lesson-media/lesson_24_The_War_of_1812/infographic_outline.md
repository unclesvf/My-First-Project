## Sections

### 1. Going to War Again
I'm Daniel, sixteen, and we're at war with Britain again. The reasons are complicated: Britain's been stopping our ships, searching them, and forcing American sailors to serve in the British navy—"impressment," they call it. Britain aids Native tribes fighting American expansion.

### 2. The Star-Spangled Banner
All night on September 13-14, 1814, British ships bombarded Fort McHenry. I watched from the city as "rockets' red glare" and "bombs bursting in air" lit up the darkness. Would the fort surrender?

### 3. The Burning of Washington
August 1814 brought America's darkest moment in the war. A British force marched on Washington D.C., our nation's capital. Our militia tried to stop them at Bladensburg, Maryland, but we broke and ran—soldiers call it the "Bladensburg Races."

British troops entered Washington unopposed.

### 4. The Hartford Convention
Three months after we defended Baltimore, in December 1814, New England Federalists met in Hartford, Connecticut. They opposed the war from the beginning—it hurt their shipping trade with Britain. Some talked openly of New England leaving the Union.

### 5. The Battle of New Orleans
The war's strangest moment came in January 1815. Andrew Jackson, commanding American forces in New Orleans, faced a battle British army. On January 8, British troops in neat formations charged American positions behind cotton bales and earthworks.

### 6. What the War Meant
The War of 1812 ended where it began—no territory changed hands, no major concessions made. Historians sometimes call it a pointless war, achieving nothing at the cost of thousands of lives. But it changed America in profound ways.
