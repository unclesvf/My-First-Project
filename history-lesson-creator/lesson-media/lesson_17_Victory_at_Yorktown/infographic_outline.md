# Infographic Outline: Victory at Yorktown

**Subtitle:** Winning Independence (1781)

**Time Period:** 1781

## Sections

### 1. A Long War
I'm Marcus, sixteen years old. My father is a freed Black man fighting for American independence in exchange for his freedom. For six years, this war has dragged on.

### 2. The Trap Closes
Washington marches his army south, coordinating with French General Rochambeau. The French fleet under Admiral de Grasse sails into Chesapeake Bay, defeating the British navy and blocking Cornwallis's escape by sea. American and French forces surround Yorktown by land.

### 3. The Siege
The siege of Yorktown lasts three weeks, and every day brings us closer to victory. Our artillery—American and French cannons positioned in carefully dug trenches—pounds the British positions day and night. The sound is constant, thunderous.

### 4. Surrender
On October 19, 1781, Cornwallis surrenders. Over 7,000 British soldiers lay down their weapons. As they march out, their band plays "The World Turned Upside Down"—an appropriate song.

### 5. What Victory Means
As I watch the British surrender, I think about what this victory means for different people. For General Washington and the Continental Army, it's vindication of over six years of sacrifice. For the French, it's revenge against their British rivals.
