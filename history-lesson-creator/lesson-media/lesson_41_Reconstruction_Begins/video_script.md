## Chapter 1: The Day of Jubilee
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Marcus, fifteen years old, and I was born enslaved on a cotton plantation in Georgia. I've worked in the fields since I was seven—planting, weeding, picking cotton from dawn to dusk. I've been whipped for working too slowly. I've watched my older sister sold away when I was ten.

## Chapter 2: The Freedmen's Bureau
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Days after emancipation, most formerly enslaved people are still on the plantations. Some leave immediately, seeking family members sold away or just wanting to experience freedom by traveling. But most stay, not because we want to but because we have nowhere else to go. The Union army establishes the Freedmen's Bureau—an agency to help formerly enslaved people transition to freedom.

## Chapter 3: The Promise of Land
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Summer 1865. There are rumors spreading through freed communities: "Forty acres and a mule." The government will give freed people land confiscated from Confederate plantations. The rumor comes from General Sherman's Special Field Order No. 15, issued in January 1865.

## Chapter 4: The Black Codes
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Fall 1865. Southern states begin passing "Black Codes"—laws specifically targeting freed people and restricting our freedom. Georgia's Black Code requires freed people to have written proof of employment. If you don't have a contract with a landowner, you can be arrested for vagrancy and forced to work for whoever pays your fine.

## Chapter 5: Presidential Reconstruction Fails
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
By late 1865, it's clear that President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policy has failed. Johnson pardoned most former Confederates, allowed them to vote and hold office, and did nothing to stop the Black Codes. He opposes federal intervention to protect freed people's rights. Johnson believes Reconstruction should be lenient and quick.
