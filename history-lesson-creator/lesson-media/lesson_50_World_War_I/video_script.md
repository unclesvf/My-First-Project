## Chapter 4: Wilson's Fourteen Points and the Treaty of Versailles
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
President Wilson arrived in Paris for the peace conference with an idealistic vision. His Fourteen Points, announced in January 1918, outlined principles for lasting peace:

• No secret treaties—open diplomacy
• Freedom of the seas
• Free trade among nations
• Reduced armaments
• Adjustment of colonial claims considering native peoples' interests
• Self-determination for European peoples—letting nations govern themselves
• League of Nations—an international organization to prevent future wars

European leaders were less idealistic. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, French Premier Georges Clemenceau, and Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando wanted to punish Germany and protect their own interests. Clemenceau was particularly harsh.
