# Infographic Outline: President Washington

**Subtitle:** First Administration (1789-1797)

**Time Period:** 1789-1797

## Sections

### 1. A New Government Begins
I'm Eleanor, fourteen, and I witnessed history today. George Washington took the oath of office as our first President on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York City. Thousands of people filled the streets, cheering and crying.

### 2. Hamilton's Financial Plan
Secretary Hamilton proposed a bold financial plan. The national government should assume all state debts from the Revolutionary War. We should create a national bank.

### 3. Staying Neutral
In 1793, France and Britain went to war. France helped us win independence—shouldn't we help them now? But Washington declared neutrality.

### 4. The Whiskey Rebellion
In 1794, farmers in western Pennsylvania rebelled against Hamilton's whiskey tax. These frontier farmers grew grain and distilled it into whiskey—easier to transport than bulky grain sacks. The tax hit them hard, and they saw it as the same kind of unfair taxation Britain had imposed.

### 5. Washington's Legacy
When Washington left office in 1797, he'd served eight years as our first President. He could have served for life—many wanted him to. But he chose to step down, proving that American presidents would serve limited terms and transfer power peacefully.
