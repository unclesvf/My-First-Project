Unlike the Pilgrims at Plymouth, we didn't want to separate from the Church of England\u2014we wanted to purify it from within. Governor Winthrop told us we were building a \"city upon a hill,\" a model Christian community that the world would look to as an example.",

Last Sunday, the Goodman family was fined for their son laughing too loudly during services. Father says frivolity has no place in worship, but sometimes I wonder if God truly frowns upon a child's joy. Our Sabbath begins Saturday evening at sunset and continues until Sunday sunset.",

We banished Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson for their beliefs, yet we ourselves fled England to escape religious persecution. Father says this is different\u2014we enforce God's true will\u2014but the contradiction troubles me. I've seen Winthrop's vision of charity and community produce remarkable things.",
