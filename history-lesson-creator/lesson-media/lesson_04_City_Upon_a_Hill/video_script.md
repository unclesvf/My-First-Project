## Chapter 1: A Holy Experiment
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
My name is John, and I am thirteen years old. My father is a Puritan minister who came to Massachusetts Bay with Governor John Winthrop. Unlike the Pilgrims at Plymouth, we didn't want to separate from the Church of England—we wanted to purify it from within. Governor Winthrop told us we were building a "city upon a hill," a model Christian community that the world would look to as an example.

## Chapter 2: Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Not everyone agreed with our strict ways. Roger Williams, a young minister, preached that the government shouldn't enforce religious laws. He said colonists should pay Native Americans for their land, not just take it. He believed in separation of church and state.

## Chapter 3: Sundays and Scrutiny
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Living in our "city upon a hill" means constant watchfulness—of ourselves and our neighbors. Last Sunday, the Goodman family was fined for their son laughing too loudly during services. Father says frivolity has no place in worship, but sometimes I wonder if God truly frowns upon a child's joy. Our Sabbath begins Saturday evening at sunset and continues until Sunday sunset.

## Chapter 4: The Puritan Way of Life
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Our colony thrived despite these controversies. We built towns around meetinghouses and common greens. Education mattered deeply to us—every town with 50 families had to hire a schoolmaster. In 1636, we founded Harvard College to train ministers.

## Chapter 5: Questions Without Answers
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Now at seventeen, I've watched our colony grow from a holy experiment into something more complex. We banished Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson for their beliefs, yet we ourselves fled England to escape religious persecution. Father says this is different—we enforce God's true will—but the contradiction troubles me. I've seen Winthrop's vision of charity and community produce remarkable things.
