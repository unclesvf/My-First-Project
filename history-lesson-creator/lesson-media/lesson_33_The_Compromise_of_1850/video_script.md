## Chapter 1: Crisis Over Slavery
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Anna, fifteen, living in San Francisco. The California Gold Rush has transformed our territory overnight. In 1848, when gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, California had maybe 14,000 non-Native residents. By 1850, we have over 100,000.

## Chapter 2: Clay's Compromise
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Henry Clay, now 73 and in failing health, proposes one last compromise to save the Union. He's brokered compromises before—the Missouri Compromise in 1820, the Tariff Compromise in 1833. He's called the "Great Compromiser," though critics say he just postpones inevitable conflicts. Clay's proposal has multiple parts: First, admit California as a free state—what we desperately want.

After months of debate, the Compromise passes in September 1850. California is admitted as the thirty-first state, a free state! We celebrate in San Francisco with parades, speeches, and fireworks. We're Americans now, full members of the Union.

## Chapter 4: Popular Sovereignty's Flaw
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The compromise's popular sovereignty provision sounds democratic—let settlers decide slavery for themselves. But it's morally bankrupt. Whether human beings can be enslaved shouldn't be decided by majority vote. And it invites conflict, as we'll see when Kansas and Nebraska territories are organized.
