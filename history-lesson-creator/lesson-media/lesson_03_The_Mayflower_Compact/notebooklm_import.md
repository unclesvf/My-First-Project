## Chapter 1: Separating from the Church

My name is Elizabeth, and I am twelve years old. My family are Separatists—we broke away from the Church of England because we believe it is corrupt. In England, this belief made us criminals. We could be jailed, fined, or worse for refusing to attend the official church.

For years, we lived in Holland, where we could worship freely. But Holland felt foreign to us. My parents worried we were losing our English ways and that I might grow up more Dutch than English. So when the Virginia Company offered us a chance to settle in America, we decided to go.

Not all of us were Separatists—we called ourselves "Saints," and we called the others "Strangers." The Strangers came for land and opportunity, not religious freedom. This caused tension aboard our ship, the Mayflower, as we crossed the Atlantic Ocean.

The voyage was terrible. For sixty-six days, we were crammed below deck in a dark, damp space. The ship pitched and rolled. People were seasick constantly. Two people died during the crossing, but one baby was born—they named him Oceanus because he was born at sea.

## Chapter 2: The Mayflower Compact

When we finally sighted land, we faced an immediate problem: we were far north of Virginia, outside the Virginia Company's territory. This meant we had no legal government. Some of the Strangers said they would do as they pleased since no laws bound them here.

Our leaders knew this could lead to chaos. So before we even left the ship, forty-one men (including my father) gathered in the Mayflower's cabin. They wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact, agreeing to form a government and obey its laws for the good of the colony.

The Compact stated that we would create "just and equal laws" for the general good. It wasn't complete democracy—women and servants couldn't sign it—but it was a remarkable agreement. We were creating our own government by consent of the governed, not by order of a king.

William Bradford became our governor. He would lead us through the darkest times ahead and write the history of our colony. The Compact became the foundation of Plymouth Colony's government and an important precedent for self-government in America.

## Chapter 3: The First Winter

We arrived in November, far too late to plant crops. We had to build shelter before winter's full fury struck. The men worked desperately to construct a common house and a few small homes, but progress was slow in the cold.

That first winter was our starving time. We had little food and inadequate shelter. A terrible sickness swept through us—probably a combination of scurvy, pneumonia, and typhus. People died almost every day. By spring, half of our 102 passengers were dead, including my mother.

I helped care for the sick, though I was just a child. I watched Father and the other survivors dig graves in the frozen ground. We buried our dead secretly at night so the native people wouldn't know how weak we'd become. We feared they might attack if they knew half of us had perished.

Only four or five women survived that winter. My aunt became like a mother to me. We lived in constant fear and grief, wondering if we'd made a terrible mistake in coming to this harsh land. Many times I wished we'd stayed in Holland, even if it meant not being fully English.

## Chapter 4: Help from Squanto

In March, an amazing thing happened. A Native American man walked into our settlement and greeted us in English! His name was Samoset, and he brought us to meet Massasoit, the leader of the Wampanoag people.

Massasoit brought with him a man named Squanto, whose story was heartbreaking. Squanto had been kidnapped by English traders years before, taken to Europe, and eventually made his way back home—only to find his entire village wiped out by disease. He was the last of his people.

Despite everything the English had done to him, Squanto chose to help us. He taught us how to plant corn using fish as fertilizer. He showed us where to find clams and eels. He taught us which plants were safe to eat and how to tap maple trees for syrup. Without his help, we would have died that second year.

We made a peace treaty with Massasoit that lasted over fifty years. In autumn of 1621, after our first successful harvest, we held a feast to celebrate. Massasoit and ninety of his men joined us for three days of eating and thanksgiving. This feast became the memory we now call the First Thanksgiving, though we didn't call it that then.

## Chapter 5: A New Beginning

I am eighteen now, and Plymouth is a real town. We have sturdy houses, productive fields, and enough food stored for winter. More ships bring new settlers each year. We're no longer desperately clinging to survival—we're building a permanent community.

Father says the Mayflower Compact was our colony's most important achievement. Not the houses we built or the crops we grew, but that agreement to govern ourselves by common consent. It proved that people could create their own government without a king commanding them. Other colonies have noticed, and some have followed our example.

Yet I cannot forget the price we paid. Mother's grave is in our hillside cemetery along with fifty others from that first winter. Squanto died four years ago from fever, still helping us negotiate with other tribes. His grave is here too. Sometimes I wonder if we had the right to take this land, even with Massasoit's blessing.

The Wampanoag helped us survive, but already I see English settlements pushing further inland, taking more land. Our children will inherit a world where we English grow stronger and the native peoples grow weaker. I pray this won't end in bloodshed, but I fear my prayers may go unanswered. We came seeking freedom to worship as we chose, and we found it. But what freedom have we taken from others? These questions haunt me even as I give thanks for our survival.
