# Infographic Outline: The Mayflower Compact

**Subtitle:** Plymouth Colony and the Pilgrims (1620-1630)

**Time Period:** 1620-1630

## Sections

### 1. Separating from the Church
My name is Elizabeth, and I am twelve years old. My family are Separatists—we broke away from the Church of England because we believe it is corrupt. In England, this belief made us criminals.

### 2. The Mayflower Compact
When we finally sighted land, we faced an immediate problem: we were far north of Virginia, outside the Virginia Company's territory. This meant we had no legal government. Some of the Strangers said they would do as they pleased since no laws bound them here.

### 3. The First Winter
We arrived in November, far too late to plant crops. We had to build shelter before winter's full fury struck. The men worked desperately to construct a common house and a few small homes, but progress was slow in the cold.

### 4. Help from Squanto
In March, an amazing thing happened. A Native American man walked into our settlement and greeted us in English! His name was Samoset, and he brought us to meet Massasoit, the leader of the Wampanoag people.

### 5. A New Beginning
I am eighteen now, and Plymouth is a real town. We have sturdy houses, productive fields, and enough food stored for winter. More ships bring new settlers each year.
