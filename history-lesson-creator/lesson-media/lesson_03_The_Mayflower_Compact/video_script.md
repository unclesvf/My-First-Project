## Chapter 1: Separating from the Church
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
My name is Elizabeth, and I am twelve years old. My family are Separatists—we broke away from the Church of England because we believe it is corrupt. In England, this belief made us criminals. We could be jailed, fined, or worse for refusing to attend the official church.

## Chapter 2: The Mayflower Compact
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
When we finally sighted land, we faced an immediate problem: we were far north of Virginia, outside the Virginia Company's territory. This meant we had no legal government. Some of the Strangers said they would do as they pleased since no laws bound them here. Our leaders knew this could lead to chaos.

**Narration:**
We arrived in November, far too late to plant crops. We had to build shelter before winter's full fury struck. The men worked desperately to construct a common house and a few small homes, but progress was slow in the cold. That first winter was our starving time.
