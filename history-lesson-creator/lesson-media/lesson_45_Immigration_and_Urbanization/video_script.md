## Chapter 3: Life in the Tenements
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
We take a ferry to Manhattan and make our way to the Lower East Side, where Uncle Paolo lives. This neighborhood is called "Little Italy"—thousands of Italian immigrants live here, speaking Italian, cooking Italian food, maintaining our culture in this strange new land. Uncle Paolo takes us to our new home: a tenement building. Tenements are cheaply built apartment buildings designed to pack as many people as possible into small spaces.
