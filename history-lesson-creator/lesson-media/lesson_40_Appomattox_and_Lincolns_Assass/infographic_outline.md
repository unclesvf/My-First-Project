## Sections

### 1. The Final Campaign
I'm Daniel, sixteen years old, and I've been a Union soldier for two years. I enlisted in 1863 after the Emancipation Proclamation. The war had become a crusade to end slavery, and I wanted to be part of it.

### 2. Palm Sunday at Appomattox
April 9, 1865. Palm Sunday. We woke to news that Confederate forces blocked Lee's retreat route.

### 3. The Armies Say Goodbye
April 12. Three days after the surrender, Confederate soldiers formally laid down their weapons. I was there, part of the Union honor guard.

### 4. Our American Cousin
April 14, 1865. Good Friday. Five days after Appomattox, the war essentially over.

Vice President Andrew Johnson became president on April 15. Johnson was a Tennessee Democrat who'd remained loyal to the Union. But he lacked Lincoln's vision, compassion, and political skill.
