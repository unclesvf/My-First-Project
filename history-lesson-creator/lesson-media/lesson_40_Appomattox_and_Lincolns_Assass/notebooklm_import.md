# Appomattox & Lincoln's Assassination

**Description:** War's End (1865)

**Narrator:** Daniel, age 16, Union soldier, 1865

## Chapter 1: The Final Campaign

I'm Daniel, sixteen years old, and I've been a Union soldier for two years. I enlisted in 1863 after the Emancipation Proclamation. The war had become a crusade to end slavery, and I wanted to be part of it.

By early 1865, the war's end was approaching. General Ulysses S. Grant commanded all Union armies. He'd been promoted after his victories at Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Grant understood that the Union's advantages—more men, more industry, more supplies—would win a war of attrition. He launched coordinated campaigns against Confederate armies across multiple fronts.

In Virginia, Grant pursued Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia relentlessly. No more cautious McClellan-style retreats after battles. Grant fought Lee continuously—the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor—then moved south, forcing Lee to defend Richmond and Petersburg.

The fighting was brutal. At Cold Harbor in June 1864, we assaulted Confederate entrenchments and lost 7,000 men in under an hour. Grant was criticized for the casualties, but he kept pressing Lee, knowing the Confederacy couldn't replace its losses.

Meanwhile, General William Sherman marched through Georgia, capturing Atlanta in September 1864, then marching to the sea. His army destroyed Confederate infrastructure—railroads, factories, warehouses. Sherman's March showed the Confederacy couldn't protect its own territory.

By spring 1865, Lee's army was trapped in Petersburg, besieged by Grant's forces. The Confederate army was starving, depleted, and demoralized. Deserters fled daily. On April 2, Grant broke through Petersburg's defenses. Lee evacuated Richmond—the Confederate capital fell.

Lee retreated west, hoping to join Confederate forces in North Carolina. Grant pursued. We marched hard, cutting off Lee's escape routes, forcing him toward a small Virginia town: Appomattox Court House.

## Chapter 2: Palm Sunday at Appomattox

April 9, 1865. Palm Sunday. We woke to news that Confederate forces blocked Lee's retreat route. Lee's army was surrounded. He had perhaps 28,000 hungry, exhausted men. Grant had over 100,000 fresh troops.

That morning, Lee attempted one final breakout. Confederate cavalry attacked Union lines blocking the road west. For a moment, it looked like they might break through. Then Union infantry reinforcements arrived. Lee's escape was impossible.

Around 8:30 a.m., a Confederate officer rode out under a white flag, requesting a truce to discuss terms. Lee would surrender.

The officers chose the home of Wilmer McLean for the surrender meeting. By strange coincidence, McLean had lived near Manassas in 1861—the first Battle of Bull Run was fought on his property. He'd moved to Appomattox to escape the war. Now the war was ending in his parlor.

Grant arrived around 1:30 p.m., muddy from hard riding. Lee was there in his finest uniform. The contrast was striking: the Confederate commander immaculate in defeat, the Union commander travel-worn in victory.

They talked briefly about old army days—both had served in the Mexican-American War. Then they discussed terms. Lee asked what Grant proposed.

Grant's terms were generous. Confederate soldiers would surrender their weapons but could keep their horses—they'd need them for spring planting. Officers could keep their sidearms. No one would be tried for treason. Soldiers could go home, and as long as they obeyed the law, they wouldn't be bothered by U.S. authorities.

Lee accepted. He asked if cavalrymen and artillerymen—who owned their own horses in the Confederate army—could keep them. Grant agreed immediately. "Let all the men who claim to own a horse or mule take the animals home with them to work their little farms," Grant said.

Lee signed the surrender document. Four years of war ended in that moment.

## Chapter 3: The Armies Say Goodbye

April 12. Three days after the surrender, Confederate soldiers formally laid down their weapons. I was there, part of the Union honor guard.

About 28,000 Confederate soldiers marched between two lines of Union troops. They carried their battle flags and stacked their rifles. Then they surrendered their flags—the flags they'd carried through dozens of battles.

It was heartbreaking to watch. These men had fought courageously for four years. They'd endured terrible hardships. They believed in their cause, wrong though it was. Now they were defeated, surrendering the symbols of everything they'd fought for.

Some Confederate soldiers cried. Others were stone-faced. They stacked their weapons with dignity, trying to maintain pride in defeat.

General Joshua Chamberlain—the hero of Little Round Top—commanded the Union troops. As the Confederates approached, Chamberlain ordered his men to carry arms, a salute of respect. The Confederate commander, General John Gordon, responded by dipping his sword in salute and ordering his men to carry arms as well.

It was a moment of mutual respect between enemies. We didn't cheer or celebrate. Grant had forbidden celebrations: "The war is over; the rebels are our countrymen again." We'd fought to preserve the Union. Now we had to reunite it.

After the surrender, Confederate soldiers began the long walk home. Many had hundreds of miles to travel. The Union army provided rations—25,000 portions of food. Some Union soldiers shared coffee and hardtack with their former enemies.

I talked with a Confederate soldier from North Carolina. He was nineteen, had fought since 1861. "I'm going home to help my family," he said. "We lost the war, lost slavery. Now we have to figure out what comes next."

The war had cost 620,000 American lives—more than all other U.S. wars combined until Vietnam. Entire towns in the South were destroyed. The economy was ruined. Slavery was ended. The United States would never be the same.

## Chapter 4: Our American Cousin

April 14, 1865. Good Friday. Five days after Appomattox, the war essentially over. President Lincoln was in good spirits. Richmond had fallen. Lee had surrendered. The Union was preserved. Slavery would be abolished—the Thirteenth Amendment was making its way through the states.

That evening, Lincoln went to Ford's Theatre in Washington to see a play: "Our American Cousin," a popular comedy. He brought his wife Mary and two guests. They sat in the presidential box overlooking the stage.

The theater was crowded. People were celebrating the war's end. The play was funny, and the audience laughed. Lincoln laughed too, finally able to relax after four years of terrible burdens.

At 10:15 p.m., during the third act, John Wilkes Booth entered the presidential box. Booth was an actor, a Confederate sympathizer, and a man consumed by hatred of Lincoln. He believed Lincoln was a tyrant who'd destroyed the South.

Booth shot Lincoln in the back of the head with a derringer pistol. Lincoln slumped forward, unconscious. Booth jumped from the box to the stage, shouting "Sic semper tyrannis!" (Thus always to tyrants). He fled the theater.

Doctors carried Lincoln to a house across the street. The bullet had entered his brain. There was no hope of recovery. Lincoln's cabinet and family gathered around his bedside. He never regained consciousness.

At 7:22 a.m. on April 15, Abraham Lincoln died. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

The news spread through Washington, then the nation. People who'd been celebrating the war's end now mourned. The man who'd preserved the Union, freed the slaves, and sought reconciliation with the South—killed just as peace arrived.

Booth was hunted down and killed twelve days later. His co-conspirators—he'd planned to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward as well—were captured and hanged. But the damage was done. Lincoln was gone.

## Chapter 5: What Might Have Been

Vice President Andrew Johnson became president on April 15. Johnson was a Tennessee Democrat who'd remained loyal to the Union. But he lacked Lincoln's vision, compassion, and political skill.

Lincoln had been planning "Reconstruction"—the process of bringing Southern states back into the Union and transforming the South from a slave society to a free one. In his second inaugural address, he'd spoken of "malice toward none, charity for all." He wanted to heal the nation's wounds quickly.

But Lincoln also believed formerly enslaved people must have rights. He'd seen Black soldiers fight for the Union—200,000 of them served after the Emancipation Proclamation. He was considering limited voting rights for Black men, particularly those who'd served in the military or were educated.

Johnson had none of Lincoln's commitment to racial equality. He opposed slavery but also opposed political and social equality for Black people. His Reconstruction policies would be lenient to former Confederates and harsh to formerly enslaved people seeking rights.

I think about what might have been if Lincoln had lived. Would Reconstruction have been more just? Would the promise of the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment been fulfilled? Would Black Americans have gained true equality rather than facing a century of segregation and discrimination?

We'll never know. History doesn't reveal its alternatives. But Lincoln's assassination was a tragedy not just for the man but for the nation. His murder robbed America of its best chance for healing and genuine transformation.

The Civil War ended slavery and preserved the Union—enormous achievements. Over 620,000 died to accomplish them. But the war didn't resolve the deeper question of racial equality. That struggle would continue for another century and more.

Standing at Appomattox, watching former enemies shake hands, I felt hope. The war was over. We'd won. Now came the harder work of building a truly united nation based on the principle that all men are created equal. Lincoln understood that challenge. His death made it far more difficult. We would spend the next century learning what we might have accomplished if Lincoln had lived to guide Reconstruction with the same wisdom he'd shown in winning the war.
