## Chapter 1: Promises Kept
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Jacob, sixteen, working at a newspaper in Philadelphia. Today we received news: the Bill of Rights has been ratified! The first ten amendments to the Constitution are now law, protecting our fundamental freedoms. During the ratification debates, Anti-Federalists feared the Constitution gave too much power to the federal government without protecting individual rights.

*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

The other amendments protect us in different ways. The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms. The Third says government can't force us to house soldiers. The Fourth protects against unreasonable searches—authorities need warrants based on probable cause.

## Chapter 3: Freedom of the Press
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
As a printer's apprentice, the First Amendment means everything to me. Before these protections, criticizing government could land you in jail. In Britain, the Crown licenses printing presses and censors publications. Seditious libel laws punish anyone who criticizes the government, even if what they say is true.

## Chapter 4: Rights of the Accused
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Last month, I attended a trial at the courthouse and saw the Bill of Rights in action. A man was accused of theft, and I watched how the amendments protected him even though he might be guilty. First, the authorities had arrested him with a proper warrant based on probable cause (Fourth Amendment). He didn't have to testify against himself (Fifth Amendment).

## Chapter 5: A Living Promise
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The Bill of Rights has been ratified, but my master says the real work is just beginning. These amendments are words on paper. They only mean something if we defend them, if courts enforce them, if citizens demand them. "Rights aren't self-executing," he tells me as we print copies of the Bill of Rights to sell.
