# Infographic Outline: The Bill of Rights

**Subtitle:** Securing Liberties (1791)

**Time Period:** 1791

## Sections

### 1. Promises Kept
I'm Jacob, sixteen, working at a newspaper in Philadelphia. Today we received news: the Bill of Rights has been ratified! The first ten amendments to the Constitution are now law, protecting our fundamental freedoms.

### 2. Protecting the People
The other amendments protect us in different ways. The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms. The Third says government can't force us to house soldiers.

### 3. Freedom of the Press
As a printer's apprentice, the First Amendment means everything to me. Before these protections, criticizing government could land you in jail. In Britain, the Crown licenses printing presses and censors publications.

### 4. Rights of the Accused
Last month, I attended a trial at the courthouse and saw the Bill of Rights in action. A man was accused of theft, and I watched how the amendments protected him even though he might be guilty. First, the authorities had arrested him with a proper warrant based on probable cause (Fourth Amendment).

### 5. A Living Promise
The Bill of Rights has been ratified, but my master says the real work is just beginning. These amendments are words on paper. They only mean something if we defend them, if courts enforce them, if citizens demand them.
