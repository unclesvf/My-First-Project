## Chapter 3: Jefferson's Dilemma
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
My father explains President Jefferson's predicament. Jefferson has always preached strict construction—the federal government should only exercise powers explicitly granted in the Constitution. He's criticized Hamilton and the Federalists for loose interpretation, claiming they stretch the Constitution to justify whatever they want. But the Constitution says nothing about purchasing foreign territory.

My city, New Orleans, is unlike anywhere else in America. We're French and Spanish, Catholic and Creole. We speak French more than English. We have free people of color who own businesses and property—something unheard of in most of America.

## Chapter 5: The Price of Expansion

While Americans celebrate acquiring vast new territory, few ask about the people already living there. Tens of thousands of Native peoples call Louisiana home: Osage, Caddo, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and dozens of other nations. France just sold their land without their consent. America just bought it without acknowledging Native ownership.
