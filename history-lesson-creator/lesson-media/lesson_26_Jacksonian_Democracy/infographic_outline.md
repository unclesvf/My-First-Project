# Infographic Outline: Jacksonian Democracy

**Subtitle:** The Age of the Common Man (1828-1840)

**Time Period:** 1828-1840

## Sections

### 1. A New Kind of President
I'm Thomas, fifteen, from Tennessee. Today Andrew Jackson was inaugurated as President, and everything feels different. Jackson isn't from a wealthy Eastern family like previous presidents—he's from the frontier, like us.

### 2. The Spoils System
Jackson introduced the "spoils system"—rewarding political supporters with government jobs. "To the victor belong the spoils," his supporters said. He fired many federal employees and replaced them with his own people.

### 3. The Bank War
Jackson's biggest battle was against the Second Bank of the United States. This national bank, chartered by Congress, controlled much of the nation's money and credit. Jackson saw it as a corrupt monopoly that favored wealthy Eastern elites over common farmers and workers.

### 4. The Rise of the Common Man
Jackson's presidency transformed American democracy. Before him, politics was dominated by wealthy, educated elites from established families. Jackson proved that a frontier-born, self-made man could become president.

### 5. The Democratic Revolution
Jackson's legacy is contradictory. He democratized American politics, making government more responsive to ordinary citizens. He fought economic elites and broke their monopoly on power.
