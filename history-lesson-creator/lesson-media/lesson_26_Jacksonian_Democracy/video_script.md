## Chapter 1: A New Kind of President
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Thomas, fifteen, from Tennessee. Today Andrew Jackson was inaugurated as President, and everything feels different. Jackson isn't from a wealthy Eastern family like previous presidents—he's from the frontier, like us. He's a war hero, a self-made man, someone who speaks for common people, not just the elite.

## Chapter 2: The Spoils System
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Jackson introduced the "spoils system"—rewarding political supporters with government jobs. "To the victor belong the spoils," his supporters said. He fired many federal employees and replaced them with his own people. Critics called this corruption—giving jobs based on loyalty rather than merit.

## Chapter 3: The Bank War
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Jackson's biggest battle was against the Second Bank of the United States. This national bank, chartered by Congress, controlled much of the nation's money and credit. Jackson saw it as a corrupt monopoly that favored wealthy Eastern elites over common farmers and workers. The Bank's president, Nicholas Biddle, was everything Jackson hated—educated, aristocratic, powerful.
