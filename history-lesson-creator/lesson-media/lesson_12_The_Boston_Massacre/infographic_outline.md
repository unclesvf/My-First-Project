# Infographic Outline: The Boston Massacre

**Subtitle:** Rising Tensions in Boston (1770)

**Time Period:** 1770

## Sections

### 1. Redcoats in Boston
My name is Abigail, and I am fourteen years old. For the past two years, British soldiers—"redcoats"—have been stationed in Boston. There are thousands of them, living among us, a constant reminder of British power.

### 2. The Night of March 5
On the cold evening of March 5, 1770, I heard shouting in the street. A crowd was harassing a British sentry, throwing snowballs and ice, calling him names. More soldiers came to help him.

### 3. The Trial and Propaganda
The soldiers were arrested and tried for murder. In a surprise move, John Adams—a patriot who opposes British policies—agreed to defend them. He believes even British soldiers deserve a fair trial and a good lawyer.

### 4. The Aftermath
The day after the shooting, acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson met with angry town leaders. Thousands of armed colonists gathered on the Common. The message was clear: remove the troops or face an uprising.

### 5. A Turning Point
In the months that followed, an uneasy quiet settled over Boston. Most of the Townshend Acts were repealed—except for the tax on tea, which Britain kept as a symbol of their right to tax us. The troops were gone from our streets.
