## Chapter 1: Religious Revival
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Emily, fifteen, from Rochester, New York—part of what they call the "Burned-Over District" because religious revivals sweep through so often it's like the land has been burned over by spiritual fire. This year, 1831, Charles Finney held a six-month revival here that transformed our town. Thousands attended meetings, hundreds converted. Finney's message differs from old Puritan theology.

## Chapter 2: Perfectionism and Reform
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The Second Great Awakening teaches that people can be perfected through faith. This idea has explosive implications: if individuals can be perfected, why not perfect society? Religious enthusiasm spills into social activism. We call it creating the "Kingdom of God on Earth."

The temperance movement grows directly from revival fervor.

## Chapter 3: The Abolition Movement
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The most radical reform inspired by the Awakening is abolition—the immediate end to slavery. William Lloyd Garrison publishes The Liberator, demanding emancipation now, without compensation to slaveholders, without colonization to Africa. His motto: "I will be heard!"

This position is far more extreme than earlier antislavery movements. Previously, antislavery meant gradual emancipation, compensating owners, perhaps sending freed people to Africa.

## Chapter 4: Women's Growing Role
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The Second Great Awakening empowers women in unexpected ways. Revivals welcome women's participation—they can testify, lead prayer groups, even sometimes preach. This challenges the traditional view that women should be silent in church and submissive at home. Women dominate reform movements numerically.
