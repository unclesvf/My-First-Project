## Chapter 1: War with Mexico

I'm Miguel, sixteen, a private in the U.S. Army fighting in Mexico. My family is from New Mexico, Spanish-speaking Catholics who've lived here for generations. When Texas joined the Union last year and President Polk sent troops to the disputed border, war became inevitable. Mexico says the border is the Nueces River. America claims it's the Rio Grande, 150 miles south. Polk ordered General Taylor to occupy the disputed zone. When Mexican troops fired on American soldiers, Polk told Congress: "American blood has been shed on American soil." War was declared in May 1846.

Many Americans support this war as Manifest Destiny—God's will for America to expand. Newspaper editor John O'Sullivan writes that we're bringing democracy and progress to backward Mexico. Young men volunteer eagerly, seeing glory and adventure. They sing songs about conquering Mexico City.

But not everyone supports the war. Abolitionists like Frederick Douglass denounce it as a scheme to expand slavery into new territories. Congressman Abraham Lincoln questions Polk's claim about where American blood was shed, demanding to see the exact "spot" where the attack occurred. He suspects Polk provoked the war deliberately. Henry David Thoreau goes to jail rather than pay taxes supporting what he calls an unjust war.

I'm conflicted. I'm American, but my family is culturally Mexican. I fight alongside Anglo soldiers who call Mexicans greasers and talk about their racial inferiority. They say we're bringing civilization to savages. But Mexico City was a great capital when English colonists were starving at Jamestown. Mexican culture is rich, complex, deeply rooted. We're not saving Mexico—we're conquering it.

## Chapter 2: The Campaigns

The war has gone badly for Mexico from the start. General Zachary Taylor captured Monterrey and defeated a larger Mexican force at Buena Vista. General Winfield Scott landed at Veracruz and marched inland toward Mexico City, following the route Cortés took three centuries earlier. Scott is brilliant—he's taken fortress after fortress with minimal American casualties.

The fighting is brutal. At Churubusco, Mexican defenders including the San Patricio Battalion—Irish-American deserters who switched sides—fought to the death rather than surrender. At Chapultepec, teenage Mexican cadets chose to die defending their military academy rather than retreat. One wrapped himself in Mexico's flag and leapt to his death rather than let it be captured. Mexicans fight with desperate courage, but American artillery and discipline prevail.

I was at the Battle of Cerro Gordo, where we flanked the Mexican army and routed them. I saw Mexican soldiers—boys my age—running in terror as American troops advanced with bayonets. Some begged for mercy in Spanish I understood but my commanding officer didn't. The killing felt like murder, not war.

By September 1847, we captured Mexico City. General Scott raised the American flag over the National Palace. Mexico's government collapsed, unable to continue the fight. We've conquered their capital, occupied their country, crushed their army. Victory is complete—and completely unjust.

## Chapter 3: The Price of Victory

The war cost about 13,000 American lives—though most died of disease, not battle. Mexican casualties were far higher, including thousands of civilians. We've devastated their country, killed their young men, occupied their capital. And for what? To seize territory Polk wanted from the beginning.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo is being negotiated now. Rumors say Mexico will lose California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming—about 55% of their pre-war territory. The Rio Grande will be the Texas border. America will pay $15 million, which sounds generous until you realize we're paying for land we took by force. It's like a thief offering to buy the wallet he just stole from you.

The treaty promises that Mexicans living in the ceded territories can keep their property and become American citizens if they choose. But I don't trust these promises. I've seen how Americans treat Mexicans. The Spanish land grants will be challenged in American courts. English-only laws will marginalize Spanish speakers. Within a generation, Californios and Tejanos will be foreigners in their own homeland.

My family in New Mexico will become Americans overnight. They're worried. Will they be equal citizens or second-class subjects? Will their Catholic faith be respected? Will their land grants be honored? Will their children speak Spanish or be forced to abandon it? Becoming American doesn't feel like opportunity—it feels like occupation.

## Chapter 4: The Slavery Question Returns

The war's most dangerous consequence isn't in Mexico—it's in America. We've gained over 500,000 square miles of new territory, and every inch reopens the question: will it be slave or free?

Even before the war ended, Congressman David Wilmot proposed the Wilmot Proviso—banning slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico. The idea inflamed the South. They'd supported the war expecting to expand slavery westward. If new territories are all free, the North will dominate Congress forever. The South threatens secession if slavery is banned from the Mexican Cession.

The North, meanwhile, increasingly opposes slavery's expansion. They see the war itself as a slaveholders' conspiracy to grab more territory for their evil institution. The Free Soil Party forms, dedicated to preventing slavery's spread. Their slogan: "Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, Free Men."

California's gold rush in 1849 makes this urgent. Thousands flood to California, creating a population large enough for statehood almost instantly. But will it be slave or free? The Missouri Compromise doesn't apply—California is too far west. We need a new compromise, and quickly.

I see the future clearly: the land we've taken from Mexico will tear America apart. Every territory we add makes the slavery conflict worse. We couldn't solve the question with the Louisiana Purchase territories. We couldn't solve it with Texas. We won't solve it with California and New Mexico. Eventually, we'll fight each other over the very territories we took from Mexico. The Mexican-American War's real casualty will be American union.

## Chapter 5: An Unjust War

Looking back, I see the Mexican-American War as a dark chapter in American history. We provoked a weaker neighbor into war, conquered half their country, and took their land. We claimed Manifest Destiny and moral superiority while acting like any other conquering empire.

President Polk got everything he wanted—California, New Mexico, settlement of the Texas border. America gained ports on the Pacific, rich mineral deposits, fertile valleys, access to trade with Asia. We've become a continental power stretching from sea to sea. In practical terms, the war was a huge success.

But morally? We attacked a weaker neighbor and took their land. We killed thousands to satisfy territorial ambitions. We broke Mexico as a nation—they'll struggle with political instability and economic weakness for generations, partly because we stripped away their richest provinces. We acted as conquerors, not liberators.

And we've poisoned ourselves in the process. The territory we gained has intensified the slavery crisis that will tear our nation apart. Within fifteen years, we'll be fighting a far bloodier war among ourselves over whether slavery can expand into these territories. The Mexican-American War will lead directly to the Civil War.

Ulysses S. Grant, who fought in Mexico and will later command Union armies, will call this "one of the most unjust wars ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation." I agree. We won the war but lost our moral standing. We gained territory but lost our innocence.

Standing in occupied Mexico City, watching American soldiers celebrate, I feel ashamed. Manifest Destiny is just a pretty name for empire. We're no different from the European powers we claim to oppose—we just use different rhetoric. We speak of freedom while conquering. We proclaim democracy while denying it to others. We invoke God's will to justify our greed.

History will remember the Mexican-American War as a successful land grab. But some of us who fought it know the truth: it was conquest dressed as destiny, imperialism wrapped in patriotism, and injustice disguised as providence. We won Mexico's land but lost America's soul.
