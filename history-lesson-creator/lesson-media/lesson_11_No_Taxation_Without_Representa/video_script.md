## Chapter 1: The Stamp Act
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
My name is William, and I am sixteen years old. I'm an apprentice at a printing shop in Boston, learning the trade from Master Green. Today, March 22, 1765, news arrived that has everyone in our shop furious: Parliament has passed the Stamp Act. This law requires colonists to buy special stamped paper for all printed materials—newspapers, legal documents, licenses, even playing cards.

## Chapter 2: Sons of Liberty
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
A group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty has formed to resist the Stamp Act. They meet at night, make plans, and intimidate anyone who supports the tax. Their leader is Samuel Adams, a firebrand who writes passionate articles against British tyranny. I watched yesterday as a mob gathered around the house of Andrew Oliver, the man appointed to distribute stamps in Massachusetts.

## Chapter 3: Colonial Unity
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
In October, representatives from nine colonies met in New York for a Stamp Act Congress. This is remarkable—the colonies rarely cooperate. But this threat has brought us together. The Congress declared that only colonial assemblies, not Parliament, have the right to tax colonists.

## Chapter 4: The Townshend Acts
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Our celebration didn't last long. In 1767, Parliament passed new taxes called the Townshend Acts, named for Charles Townshend, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. These taxes are different from the Stamp Act—they're duties on imported goods like tea, glass, lead, paint, and paper. Parliament thinks they're being clever.

## Chapter 5: The Power of Resistance
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
These years have taught me something profound: ordinary people have power when they stand together. I'm just a printer's apprentice, but when I refuse to buy British tea, when Master Green prints pamphlets explaining our rights, when my neighbors boycott imported goods—we're all part of something larger. Women have become crucial to this resistance. They're called the "Daughters of Liberty," and they organize spinning bees to produce homemade cloth.
