## Chapter 1: The Tariff Crisis
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm James, sixteen, from South Carolina. Our state is in uproar over what we call the "Tariff of Abominations." This high protective tariff helps Northern manufacturers by making imported goods expensive, forcing Americans to buy Northern-made products. But we don't manufacture—we grow cotton. The tariff devastates our economy.

## Chapter 2: Calhoun's Theory
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Father explains Calhoun's logic: the Constitution is a compact among sovereign states. The states created the federal government and delegated it certain limited powers. When the federal government exceeds those powers, states have the right to judge and resist. Calhoun argues that the tariff isn't a legitimate revenue measure—it's designed to protect one section's industry at another section's expense.

## Chapter 3: Jackson's Response

## Chapter 4: Clay's Compromise
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Henry Clay, the "Great Compromiser," found a way out. He proposed gradually reducing the tariff over ten years while simultaneously passing Jackson's Force Bill. South Carolina could claim victory—the tariff would be lowered. Jackson could claim victory—federal supremacy was maintained.

## Chapter 5: The Crisis's Meaning
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The Nullification Crisis revealed deep fractures in American unity. It showed that sectional loyalty can rival national loyalty, that states might choose disunion over submission to national majority rule. It foreshadowed the Civil War. The arguments South Carolina made in 1832—states' rights, federal tyranny, right to resist—would echo in 1861 when Southern states seceded.
