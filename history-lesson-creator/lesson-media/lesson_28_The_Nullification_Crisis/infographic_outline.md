# Infographic Outline: The Nullification Crisis

**Subtitle:** States' Rights vs Federal Power (1832)

**Time Period:** 1832

## Sections

### 1. The Tariff Crisis
I'm James, sixteen, from South Carolina. Our state is in uproar over what we call the "Tariff of Abominations." This high protective tariff helps Northern manufacturers by making imported goods expensive, forcing Americans to buy Northern-made products. But we don't manufacture—we grow cotton.

### 2. Calhoun's Theory
Father explains Calhoun's logic: the Constitution is a compact among sovereign states. The states created the federal government and delegated it certain limited powers. When the federal government exceeds those powers, states have the right to judge and resist.

### 3. Jackson's Response
President Jackson's reaction shocked us. Jackson is a Southerner, a states' rights advocate, a slave owner. We expected sympathy.

### 4. Clay's Compromise
Henry Clay, the "Great Compromiser," found a way out. He proposed gradually reducing the tariff over ten years while simultaneously passing Jackson's Force Bill. South Carolina could claim victory—the tariff would be lowered.

### 5. The Crisis's Meaning
The Nullification Crisis revealed deep fractures in American unity. It showed that sectional loyalty can rival national loyalty, that states might choose disunion over submission to national majority rule. It foreshadowed the Civil War.
