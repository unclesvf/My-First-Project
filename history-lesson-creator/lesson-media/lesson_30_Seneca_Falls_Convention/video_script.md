## Chapter 1: Declaration of Sentiments
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Charlotte, seventeen, attending the first women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized this gathering—about 300 people, including 40 men. Frederick Douglass, the great abolitionist, came to support us. Stanton drafted a "Declaration of Sentiments" that mirrors the Declaration of Independence.

## Chapter 2: The Case for Women's Rights
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The convention challenges the doctrine of "separate spheres"—the idea that men naturally belong in public life (politics, business, the professions) while women naturally belong in domestic life (home, children, moral influence). This ideology claims women are too delicate, too emotional, too pure for the rough world of politics and commerce. Stanton argues these aren't natural differences but social constructions. Women seem unsuited for public life because they're denied education, experience, and opportunity—not because they lack capability.

## Chapter 3: Immediate Backlash
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The convention concluded with 68 women and 32 men signing the Declaration of Sentiments. We left energized, hopeful, ready to change the world. Then the newspapers arrived. The mockery is brutal.

## Chapter 4: The Long Road Ahead
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

## Chapter 5: Planting Seeds
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Standing in Seneca Falls at the close of the convention, I understand we've started something that will outlive us all. We're not demanding immediate change—we know that's impossible. We're planting seeds that future generations will harvest. The Declaration of Sentiments gives the women's rights movement its founding document, its statement of principles, its catalogue of grievances.
