**Subtitle:** The Seven Years' War in America (1754-1763)

**Time Period:** 1754-1763

## Sections

### 1. Clash of Empires
My name is Benjamin, and I am sixteen years old. I joined the Virginia militia last spring, following a young officer named George Washington into the wilderness beyond the Allegheny Mountains. We were sent to protect Virginia's claim to the Ohio River Valley—land that both England and France claim ...

### 2. Braddock's Defeat
The next year, the British sent General Edward Braddock with two regiments of professional soldiers. They were going to capture Fort Duquesne, the French stronghold where Pittsburgh stands today. I marched with them, part of the colonial militia supporting the British regulars.

### 3. The Tide Turns
For several years, the war went badly for Britain. The French won victory after victory. Their Native allies raided frontier settlements, and colonists fled east for safety.

### 4. Seeds of Revolution
The war changed everything, though we didn't see it at first. Britain had huge war debts and thought the colonies should help pay them—after all, the war had been fought partly for our benefit. They planned to station 10,000 troops in America and expected us to help pay for them through new taxes.

### 5. The Other Side
I'm older now, twenty-five, with scars from battles and memories that haunt me. Time has given me perspective I lacked as a young militiaman. We celebrated Britain's victory, but I've come to understand what we rarely acknowledged: this was someone else's loss, someone else's catastrophe.
