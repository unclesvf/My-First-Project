My name is Hannah, and I am sixteen years old. My father is a delegate to the Continental Congress meeting here in Philadelphia. In January, a pamphlet called "Common Sense" by Thomas Paine swept through the colonies like wildfire. Father brought a copy home, and I read it with amazement.

## Chapter 2: Writing the Declaration
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
On June 7, Richard Henry Lee proposed that "these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States." The Congress appointed a committee to draft a declaration: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and two others. Jefferson did most of the writing. I saw him around Philadelphia, looking tired and worried. He wrote at a portable desk in his rented room, choosing each word carefully.

## Chapter 4: Revolutionary Ideas
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The Declaration is more than a list of complaints against King George. It's a statement of revolutionary political philosophy drawn from Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke. The ideas it expresses will echo through history. First, it asserts that all people have natural rights that governments cannot legitimately take away.

## Chapter 5: The Price of Freedom
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
After the signing, Benjamin Franklin reportedly said, "We must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately." He meant it literally. By signing the Declaration, fifty-six men committed treason against Britain. If we lose this war, they'll be executed. I've watched the strain on Father's face.
