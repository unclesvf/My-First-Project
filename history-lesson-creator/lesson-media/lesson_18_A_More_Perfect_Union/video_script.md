## Chapter 1: The Articles of Confederation Fail
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
I'm Rebecca, fifteen, living in Philadelphia. My father is a delegate to a special convention meeting here. After winning independence, our states created the Articles of Confederation—a weak central government that's failing. Congress can't collect taxes, regulate trade, or enforce laws.

## Chapter 2: The Great Compromise
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Father comes home exhausted each night, unable to tell me details—they've sworn secrecy. But I overhear conversations. The big debate is representation: Should each state have equal votes, or should larger states have more power based on population? Delegates are deadlocked.

## Chapter 3: The Constitution's Framework
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The Constitution creates a government of separated powers designed to prevent tyranny. The delegates remembered how British power had been abused, so they built a system where no one branch could dominate. The Legislative Branch (Congress) makes laws. It's divided into two houses: the Senate and House of Representatives.

## Chapter 4: Ratification and the Bill of Rights
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The Constitution is finished—creating three branches of government with checks and balances, federalism dividing power between national and state governments. But it needs ratification by nine of thirteen states. Federalists like Hamilton, Madison, and Jay support it, writing essays called The Federalist Papers. Anti-Federalists like Patrick Henry oppose it, saying it gives too much power to the central government and lacks protection for individual rights.

## Chapter 5: A Living Experiment
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Father brought home a printed copy of the Constitution. I read the Preamble carefully: "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."

"More perfect"—not perfect, but more perfect. Father explains that the delegates knew they hadn't created a perfect document. The Three-Fifths Compromise treats human beings as property.
