## Chapter 1: Life in the City
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
My name is Rachel, and I am fifteen years old. I live in Philadelphia, the largest city in the colonies with over 20,000 people. Our city has paved streets, brick buildings, street lamps, and a bustling port. It's a world away from the frontier settlements Father tells stories about.

## Chapter 2: Education and Ideas
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Education matters greatly to colonists, though it varies by region and class. In New England, towns fund public schools because Puritans believe everyone should read the Bible. The Middle Colonies have private schools and academies. The South educates wealthy children with private tutors, while poor children receive little formal education.

## Chapter 3: Different Regions, Shared Identity
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Despite our differences, a shared colonial identity is emerging. We're beginning to see ourselves not just as Virginians or New Yorkers, but as Americans—distinct from the British. Trade connects us. New England ships carry grain from the Middle Colonies and tobacco from the South.

## Chapter 4: The Coming Storm

Last week, news arrived that makes Father worried. Britain has huge debts from the French and Indian War—over £140 million. Parliament plans to raise taxes on the colonies to help pay for it. They'll station 10,000 troops here and expect us to help pay their costs.

## Chapter 5: Contradictions and Possibilities
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Today, I helped Father set type for a pamphlet about natural rights. The author argues that all men are created equal, that they possess inalienable rights to life, liberty, and property. As I arranged the metal letters, I wondered: does "all men" include women like me? Does it include the enslaved man who delivers paper to our shop?
