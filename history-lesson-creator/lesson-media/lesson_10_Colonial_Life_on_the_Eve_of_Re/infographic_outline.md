# Infographic Outline: Colonial Life on the Eve of Revolution

## Sections

### 1. Life in the City
My name is Rachel, and I am fifteen years old. I live in Philadelphia, the largest city in the colonies with over 20,000 people. Our city has paved streets, brick buildings, street lamps, and a bustling port.

### 2. Education and Ideas
Education matters greatly to colonists, though it varies by region and class. In New England, towns fund public schools because Puritans believe everyone should read the Bible. The Middle Colonies have private schools and academies.

### 3. Different Regions, Shared Identity
Despite our differences, a shared colonial identity is emerging. We're beginning to see ourselves not just as Virginians or New Yorkers, but as Americans—distinct from the British. Trade connects us.

### 4. The Coming Storm
Last week, news arrived that makes Father worried. Britain has huge debts from the French and Indian War—over £140 million. Parliament plans to raise taxes on the colonies to help pay for it.

### 5. Contradictions and Possibilities
Today, I helped Father set type for a pamphlet about natural rights. The author argues that all men are created equal, that they possess inalienable rights to life, liberty, and property. As I arranged the metal letters, I wondered: does "all men" include women like me?
