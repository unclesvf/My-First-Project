I'm Joseph, seventeen, a soldier in General Washington's Continental Army. It's December 1777, and we've lost Philadelphia to the British. We're marching to winter camp at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Many soldiers have no shoes—I can track our route by bloody footprints in the snow.

## Chapter 2: Trials of Valley Forge

Valley Forge is hell on earth. We build crude log huts, twelve men crammed in each. The cold seeps through every crack. We have little food—sometimes just "firecake" (flour and water baked on stones) and watery soup.

In February, Baron von Steuben arrives—a Prussian military officer who volunteers to train us. He doesn't speak English well, but he teaches us to march in formation, load muskets quickly, use bayonets effectively. He makes us into real soldiers. Before von Steuben, we were farmers with guns.

## Chapter 4: Daily Survival
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

Every day at Valley Forge is a battle for survival. We wake before dawn to the sound of drums. Those healthy enough for duty drill or stand guard. The sick—and there are always hundreds sick—lie in the huts, shivering with fever.
