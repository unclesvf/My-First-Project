# Infographic Outline: Winter at Valley Forge

**Subtitle:** Revolutionary War Hardships (1777-1778)

**Time Period:** 1777-1778

## Sections

### 1. Defeat and Despair
I'm Joseph, seventeen, a soldier in General Washington's Continental Army. It's December 1777, and we've lost Philadelphia to the British. We're marching to winter camp at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

### 2. Trials of Valley Forge
Valley Forge is hell on earth. We build crude log huts, twelve men crammed in each. The cold seeps through every crack.

### 3. Baron von Steuben
In February, Baron von Steuben arrives—a Prussian military officer who volunteers to train us. He doesn't speak English well, but he teaches us to march in formation, load muskets quickly, use bayonets effectively. He makes us into real soldiers.

### 4. Daily Survival
Every day at Valley Forge is a battle for survival. We wake before dawn to the sound of drums. Those healthy enough for duty drill or stand guard.

### 5. Transformation
When we marched into Valley Forge in December, we were a defeated, disorganized rabble. When we marched out in June, we were an army. The transformation wasn't just about von Steuben's training, though that mattered.
