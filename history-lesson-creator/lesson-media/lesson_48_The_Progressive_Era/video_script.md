*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Woodrow Wilson wins the presidency in 1912, running as a Progressive Democrat against Theodore Roosevelt (running as a Progressive/Bull Moose candidate) and conservative Republican William Howard Taft. Wilson's "New Freedom" program aims to restore competition by breaking up monopolies rather than just regulating them. He achieves major reforms:

The Underwood Tariff (1913) reduces import taxes, lowering consumer prices and reducing corporate protection from foreign competition. To replace lost revenue, it establishes the first permanent federal income tax under the new Sixteenth Amendment.

## Chapter 5: The Progressive Legacy—Promise and Limits
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
By 1920, I'm 25 years old and still involved in reform work. The Progressive Era has transformed America in remarkable ways. We've achieved major reforms:
• Pure Food and Drug Act protects consumers
• Antitrust laws limit monopoly power
• Conservation preserves natural resources
• Income tax and direct election of senators make government more democratic
• Labor laws improve working conditions (though child labor and long hours persist)
• Women won the vote with the Nineteenth Amendment (1920)

But the Progressive Era has serious limitations and contradictions. Racial injustice: Most Progressives ignore or actively support segregation.
