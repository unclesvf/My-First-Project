**Subtitle:** The Middle Colonies: New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware (1664-1700)

**Time Period:** 1664-1700

## Sections

### 1. From New Netherland to New York
My name is Maria, and I am fourteen years old. I live in New York, though my family still calls it by its old name: New Amsterdam. My parents are Dutch, and they remember when this colony belonged to the Netherlands, not England.

### 2. Penn's Holy Experiment
My uncle moved to Pennsylvania, the new colony founded by William Penn, a Quaker. The Quakers are strange to us—they believe everyone is equal before God, they refuse to take oaths or fight in wars, and they let women preach in their meetings. In England, they're persecuted for these beliefs.

### 3. Market Day
Tuesday is market day at the dock, and I help Father sell goods from his warehouse. The waterfront buzzes with activity—ships arriving from London, Amsterdam, the Caribbean. Sailors speak in tongues I don't recognize, their skin bearing the sun of distant seas.

### 4. A Different Kind of Colony
The Middle Colonies are different from New England and the South. In New England, the Puritans control everything—religion, government, daily life. They don't tolerate other beliefs.

### 5. The Price of Tolerance
Not everyone celebrates our diversity. Some ministers warn that tolerating false religions invites God's wrath. When a Catholic family moved onto our street, neighbors muttered about popish plots and foreign loyalties.
