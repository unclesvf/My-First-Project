## Chapter 1: Into the Unknown

I'm William, seventeen, and I'm part of the greatest adventure in American history. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark are leading the Corps of Discovery—about 40 men—to explore the Louisiana Purchase and beyond, all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

President Jefferson gave Lewis specific orders: map the territory, find a water route to the Pacific, study plants and animals, establish relations with Native tribes. We left St. Louis in May 1804, traveling up the Missouri River in keelboats. None of us know what we'll find.

The land is beautiful and terrifying. We've seen buffalo herds stretching to the horizon, grizzly bears that attack without provocation, landscapes unlike anything in the East. We take detailed notes, collect specimens, draw maps. Every day brings new wonders and dangers.

## Chapter 2: Sacagawea's Help

In North Dakota, we met Sacagawea, a Shoshone woman who joined us as interpreter and guide. She's about sixteen and carries her baby son on her back. Her presence signals peaceful intentions to tribes we meet—no war party travels with a woman and baby.

Sacagawea proved invaluable. She helped us communicate with tribes, identified edible plants, found routes through mountains. When we reached Shoshone territory, their chief was her brother! She helped us trade for horses we desperately needed to cross the mountains.

We reached the Pacific Ocean in November 1805. We'd traveled 4,000 miles through unmapped wilderness. We spent the winter near the coast, then returned, arriving back in St. Louis in September 1806. We'd been gone over two years. People thought we were dead!

Our expedition proved there's no easy water route to the Pacific—the Rocky Mountains block it. But we mapped vast territories, established American claims to the Pacific Northwest, made contact with Native peoples, and brought back knowledge of lands most Americans couldn't imagine.

## Chapter 3: Encounters with Native Peoples

The expedition's success depended entirely on Native peoples. We didn't discover anything—Native nations had lived in and traveled through these lands for thousands of years. They shared knowledge that saved our lives.

The Mandan people sheltered us through our first winter. They shared food, showed us how to hunt buffalo, taught us survival techniques. Without their hospitality, we would have starved or frozen.

Most tribes we encountered were peaceful and helpful, offering food, horses, and directions. They were curious about us, and we about them. Captain Lewis held councils, distributed gifts, and told tribes they were now under American authority. I don't think the tribes took this seriously—we were a small party passing through. They humored us.

But our presence foreshadowed what was coming. We were scouts for American expansion. Our maps would guide settlers, traders, and soldiers into these territories. The friendly tribes helping us didn't realize they were assisting in their own dispossession.

York, Captain Clark's enslaved servant, fascinated many tribes—some had never seen a Black person. York was a full member of our expedition, hunting, voting on decisions, equal in our hardships. But he remained enslaved, a contradiction that troubled me. How could we explore in the name of liberty while denying York his freedom?

## Chapter 4: The Rocky Mountains

Nothing prepared us for the Rocky Mountains. Jefferson hoped we'd find an easy passage—maybe a short portage between rivers. Instead, we found a seemingly endless range of rugged peaks.

The crossing nearly killed us. We struggled through snow in September, leading horses over treacherous mountain paths. Food ran out. We ate candles and portable soup. Some men wanted to turn back, but Captains Lewis and Clark pushed forward.

The Nez Perce people saved us. When we stumbled out of the mountains, starving and desperate, they fed us and guided us to rivers flowing west. They could have left us to die or killed us for our supplies. Instead, they showed mercy and hospitality. I'll never forget their kindness.

Crossing the Rockies destroyed Jefferson's dream of a transcontinental water route for trade. The mountains were too vast, too harsh. But the crossing taught us something valuable: this continent was grander and more diverse than we'd imagined. The West wasn't just a bigger version of the East—it was something entirely different.

Standing on the Continental Divide, looking west toward the Pacific, I felt both triumph and humility. We'd accomplished an amazing journey, but the land had defeated our presumptions. Nature was bigger than our ambitions. The West would shape us more than we'd shape it.

## Chapter 5: Reaching the Pacific

On November 7, 1805, we finally saw it—the Pacific Ocean. "Ocean in view! O! the joy!" Clark wrote in his journal. We'd traveled 4,000 miles from St. Louis. We'd crossed plains, mountains, and rivers. We'd survived grizzly bears, starvation, disease, and accidents. And we'd made it.

We spent a miserable winter near the mouth of the Columbia River. Rain fell constantly. Our clothing rotted. Food was scarce. The ocean we'd worked so hard to reach brought endless storms and dampness. But we'd achieved our goal.

We built Fort Clatsop and waited for winter to pass. We documented plants and animals, wrote extensive journals, prepared for the return journey. Every member of the expedition—including York and Sacagawea—voted on where to build the fort. This democratic decision-making felt very American.

The journey back in 1806 was faster because we knew the route. When we reached St. Louis in September, people were amazed—most had assumed we'd died. We'd been gone 28 months, traveled 8,000 miles, and lost only one man (to appendicitis).

We'd failed to find a water route to the Pacific. But we'd succeeded in something greater: we'd mapped a continental nation. We'd proven Americans could reach the Pacific overland. We'd made contact with dozens of Native nations. We'd collected scientific specimens and geographical knowledge. We'd expanded American understanding of the West from myth to reality.

## Chapter 6: What We Discovered

The Lewis and Clark Expedition changed America's vision of itself. Before, Americans thought of their nation as confined to lands east of the Mississippi. After, they imagined a nation spanning the continent.

We brought back detailed maps, journals filled with scientific observations, specimens of unknown plants and animals. We'd documented over 170 plant species and 120 animal species unknown to science. We'd established diplomatic relations with Native tribes and charted rivers and mountains.

But our "discovery" came at a cost. We weren't exploring empty wilderness—we were mapping lands home to hundreds of thousands of Native peoples. Our expedition would guide American settlers, traders, and soldiers into these territories, beginning the dispossession of Native nations.

I think about Sacagawea, who helped us so much. She'd been kidnapped from her Shoshone people as a child, sold to a French trader. Her people had been pushed westward by tribes with guns. Now we were bringing more Americans with more guns, more diseases, more hunger for land. Our expedition was the opening chapter of a story that wouldn't end well for Native peoples.

Captain Lewis struggled with depression after the expedition and eventually took his own life. I sometimes wonder if the gap between our high ideals and harsh reality troubled him. We'd explored in the name of enlightenment and science, but we'd really been scouting for conquest.

Still, the expedition taught me something valuable: America is vast, diverse, and amazing. From the Mississippi to the Pacific, from plains to mountains, our continent holds wonders beyond imagination. We'd proven that Americans could undertake great endeavors and succeed through cooperation, perseverance, and respect for the land.

The West was no longer unknown. For better and worse, Americans would now flood across the continent we'd mapped. The age of western expansion was beginning, and we'd opened the door.
