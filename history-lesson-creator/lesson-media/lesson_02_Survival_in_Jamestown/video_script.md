## Chapter 1: Arrival in Virginia
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
My name is Samuel, and I am fourteen years old. I came to Virginia as an indentured servant, bound to work for seven years in exchange for passage to this new land. The Virginia Company promised riches and opportunity, but what I found was something very different. When our ship sailed up the James River in the spring of 1609, I saw a small fort surrounded by endless forests.

## Chapter 2: The Starving Time
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The winter of 1609 brought horror beyond imagination. We called it the "Starving Time." Captain Smith had been injured and returned to England, leaving us without strong leadership. The Powhatans, tired of our demands for food, stopped trading with us and surrounded the fort. We were trapped.

## Chapter 3: Tobacco Saves the Colony
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
A man named John Rolfe changed everything when he began growing tobacco. He experimented with seeds from the Caribbean, creating a variety that grew well in Virginia's soil and tasted sweet when smoked. The English couldn't get enough of it. Suddenly, we had found our gold—not the metal kind, but green leaves that brought profit.

## Chapter 4: The First Representative Government
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
In 1619, something remarkable happened. The Virginia Company allowed us to form the House of Burgesses, the first representative assembly in the American colonies. We could elect burgesses to make local laws, as long as they didn't contradict the company's rules or English law. For the first time, colonists had a voice in their own government.

*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Today I am twenty-four years old. Three years ago I completed my seven years of indenture and became a free man. Master Thompson gave me my freedom dues: fifty acres of land, tools, seed corn, and two sets of clothes. I own nothing else, but I own myself, and that means everything.
