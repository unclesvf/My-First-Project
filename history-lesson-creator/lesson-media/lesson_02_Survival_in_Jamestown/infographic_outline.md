# Infographic Outline: Survival in Jamestown

**Subtitle:** The Struggles of the First Permanent English Colony (1607-1620)

**Time Period:** 1607-1620

## Sections

### 1. Arrival in Virginia
My name is Samuel, and I am fourteen years old. I came to Virginia as an indentured servant, bound to work for seven years in exchange for passage to this new land. The Virginia Company promised riches and opportunity, but what I found was something very different.

### 2. The Starving Time
The winter of 1609 brought horror beyond imagination. We called it the "Starving Time." Captain Smith had been injured and returned to England, leaving us without strong leadership. The Powhatans, tired of our demands for food, stopped trading with us and surrounded the fort.

### 3. Tobacco Saves the Colony
A man named John Rolfe changed everything when he began growing tobacco. He experimented with seeds from the Caribbean, creating a variety that grew well in Virginia's soil and tasted sweet when smoked. The English couldn't get enough of it.

### 4. The First Representative Government
In 1619, something remarkable happened. The Virginia Company allowed us to form the House of Burgesses, the first representative assembly in the American colonies. We could elect burgesses to make local laws, as long as they didn't contradict the company's rules or English law.

### 5. Freedom's Promise and Price
Today I am twenty-four years old. Three years ago I completed my seven years of indenture and became a free man. Master Thompson gave me my freedom dues: fifty acres of land, tools, seed corn, and two sets of clothes.
