## Chapter 1: The Journey Begins

My name is Mateo, and I am thirteen years old. Today marks my first full year in this strange new land called La Florida. I still remember the smell of the salt air as our ship approached the coast, the way my stomach churned—not from seasickness, but from fear and excitement twisted together like rope.

Father told me we were coming to build a new life, to claim land for Spain and spread our faith. The King himself had sent us, led by Don Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, to establish a settlement and drive out the French who dared to settle in Spanish territory.

When we first landed, the heat was unlike anything I'd known in Seville. The air was thick and heavy, and strange birds called from trees I'd never seen before. The indigenous Timucua people watched us from the forest edge—curious, cautious, but not yet hostile.

We called our settlement St. Augustine, and immediately set to work building wooden fortifications. Every day, I helped carry timber and dig trenches. My hands, once soft from my mother's gentle care, grew calloused and strong.

## Chapter 2: Survival and Struggle

The first months were the hardest. We planted crops, but the soil was different here, and many plants withered in the unforgiving sun. Fish from the nearby waters kept us alive when our Spanish provisions ran low.

I learned to respect the Timucua. They showed us which plants were safe to eat, how to track animals through the palmetto scrub, and where to find fresh water. Without them, I don't think we would have survived.

But tension simmered beneath our fragile peace. Some Spanish soldiers treated the Timucua poorly, demanding food and labor. Father argued with the garrison commander about this, saying we would never truly settle here if we made enemies of those who knew the land.

I befriended a Timucua boy named Ahone, who was about my age. He taught me words in his language, and I taught him Spanish. We would meet by the river when we could, away from the suspicious eyes of both our peoples.

## Chapter 3: Building a New World

As seasons passed, St. Augustine grew from a desperate outpost into something resembling a town. We built a wooden chapel where Father Alonso held mass each Sunday. Stone replaced wood in our most important buildings, making them strong against both storms and attack.

Supplies arrived from Havana every few months—tools, seeds, fabric, and news from Spain. Each ship brought new settlers: farmers, craftsmen, soldiers, and priests. The settlement expanded, pushing deeper into the wilderness.

The Spanish Crown wanted us to convert the indigenous people to Christianity and make them subjects of King Philip II. Some missionaries succeeded in baptizing Timucua families, but others resisted, clinging to their old ways and gods.

I often wondered what Ahone thought about all this—his world changing so rapidly, his people's land filling with strangers who spoke of a distant king and demanded obedience. When I asked him once, he simply said, "The world has always been changing, Mateo. The question is whether we change with it or are swept away."

## Chapter 4: Two Worlds Collide

By my second year in St. Augustine, I understood that we were not just building a settlement—we were building an empire. Spain claimed this land, and settlements like ours were the foundation of that claim.

Father explained to me how our settlement fit into Spain's vast colonial empire. "We are not alone in this endeavor, Mateo," he said one evening. "To the south, our countrymen have built great cities. Santo Domingo on Hispaniola was founded seventy years ago and now has a university, a cathedral, and thousands of Spanish settlers. Havana in Cuba is nearly fifty years old and serves as the key to the Caribbean. From Mexico City to Lima in Peru, Spanish settlements are transforming these lands."

He told me that St. Augustine was Spain's answer to threats from France and other European powers. "The French tried to establish Fort Caroline just north of here last year, but we drove them out. Now we must prove that La Florida can be held, civilized, and made profitable for the Crown. We are the northern frontier of New Spain, the guardians of the treasure fleets that sail past our coast carrying silver from Peru and Mexico back to Spain."

I realized then that this "New World" was not new at all—it was ancient, with people who had lived here for generations beyond counting. What was new was us: the Spanish bringing Christianity, Spanish law, and European ways to lands that had their own rich cultures long before we arrived. The Timucua had thrived here for countless generations, yet we treated them as if they had been waiting for us to bring them civilization.

Yet here I am, part of this great expansion. My children will be born in this land, speaking Spanish but living lives my grandparents in Seville could never imagine. We are creating something new from the meeting of old worlds—though at what cost, I'm still not sure.

## Chapter 5: Reflections on Settlement

Looking back now, I see the pattern clearly. St. Augustine follows the same path as older Spanish settlements throughout the Americas. Santo Domingo was established for the same reasons we came here: to claim territory, find wealth, spread Christianity, and expand Spain's empire. Like Santo Domingo, like Havana, like Mexico City—we all struggled through harsh conditions, disease, and conflict in our early years.

We all depended on indigenous peoples for survival at first, yet Spain sought to dominate them through systems like the *encomienda*. I've heard from sailors who've been to Hispaniola that the Taíno people who once lived there in great numbers have nearly vanished—destroyed by European diseases, forced labor, and violence. The same pattern happened in Cuba, in Puerto Rico, across the Caribbean islands. Now I fear the same fate awaits the Timucua here in La Florida.

What makes me sad is how little we learn from the humanity of those who were here first. The Timucua are not obstacles to overcome or resources to exploit. They are people with their own rich cultures, histories, and rights to this land. They had built lives here for countless generations before any European ship touched these shores. Yet we treat them as if they existed only to serve Spain's ambitions.

Father once told me that history is written by those who build the strongest settlements and win the most battles. But I wonder: what will history say about us? Will it remember the bravery of exploration and the building of new settlements, or the tragedy of conquest and the destruction of entire peoples? Will it honor the Timucua voices, or silence them beneath the weight of Spanish ambition—just as the Taíno voices have been silenced in the islands to the south?

These are the questions I carry with me as I grow into manhood in this New World—questions that have no easy answers, but must be asked nonetheless. I am part of Spain's great colonial enterprise, yet I cannot help but wonder if we are building our empire on foundations of injustice that will haunt us for generations to come.
