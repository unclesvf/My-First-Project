## Chapter 1: The Journey Begins
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
My name is Mateo, and I am thirteen years old. Today marks my first full year in this strange new land called La Florida. I still remember the smell of the salt air as our ship approached the coast, the way my stomach churned—not from seasickness, but from fear and excitement twisted together like rope. Father told me we were coming to build a new life, to claim land for Spain and spread our faith.

## Chapter 2: Survival and Struggle
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The first months were the hardest. We planted crops, but the soil was different here, and many plants withered in the unforgiving sun. Fish from the nearby waters kept us alive when our Spanish provisions ran low. I learned to respect the Timucua.

## Chapter 3: Building a New World
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
As seasons passed, St. Augustine grew from a desperate outpost into something resembling a town. We built a wooden chapel where Father Alonso held mass each Sunday. Stone replaced wood in our most important buildings, making them strong against both storms and attack.

## Chapter 4: Two Worlds Collide
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
By my second year in St. Augustine, I understood that we were not just building a settlement—we were building an empire. Spain claimed this land, and settlements like ours were the foundation of that claim. Father explained to me how our settlement fit into Spain's vast colonial empire.

## Chapter 5: Reflections on Settlement
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Looking back now, I see the pattern clearly. St. Augustine follows the same path as older Spanish settlements throughout the Americas. Santo Domingo was established for the same reasons we came here: to claim territory, find wealth, spread Christianity, and expand Spain's empire.
