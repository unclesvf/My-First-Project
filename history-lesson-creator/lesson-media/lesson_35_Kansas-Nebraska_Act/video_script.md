I'm John, seventeen years old, and my family moved to Kansas Territory in 1855. We came from Ohio seeking good farmland and a fresh start. Kansas seemed like the perfect opportunity. The Kansas-Nebraska Act, passed by Congress in 1854, created Kansas and Nebraska territories.

The 1855 territorial election should have been straightforward: Kansas settlers vote on whether to allow slavery. Instead, it became a farce. Days before the election, thousands of armed Missourians—called "Border Ruffians"—crossed into Kansas. They weren't settlers.

## Chapter 5: Democracy Fails
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
Kansas eventually joined the Union as a free state in 1861—but only after the Southern states had already seceded. By then, the lesson of Kansas was clear: the slavery question couldn't be solved through popular sovereignty, compromise, or peaceful politics. Looking back, I understand what went wrong. Popular sovereignty sounded democratic, but it failed because both sides refused to accept outcomes they opposed.
