## Chapter 2: Two Strategies—NAWSA and the NWP
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
By the early 1900s, the suffrage movement split into two organizations with different strategies. The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), led by Carrie Chapman Catt, pursued a state-by-state strategy. They lobbied state legislatures to grant women voting rights, believing success at the state level would build momentum for a federal amendment. Wyoming granted women's suffrage in 1869, followed by Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and eventually fifteen states by 1914.

## Chapter 3: The Final Push—Wilson Changes His Mind
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
President Woodrow Wilson initially opposed women's suffrage, saying it was a state issue, not a federal one. But the combination of NAWSA's lobbying, the NWP's protests, and women's contributions to the war effort changed his mind. During World War I, women took jobs in factories, served as nurses, sold war bonds, and managed farms while men fought overseas. They proved they could handle responsibilities traditionally reserved for men.

## Chapter 5: Victory Incomplete
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

**Narration:**
The celebration is joyful but also bittersweet. We've won a crucial victory, but equality is far from achieved. First, many Black women still can't vote. The Nineteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination "on account of sex," but Southern states use the same Jim Crow tactics against Black women that they use against Black men: poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, violence, and intimidation.
