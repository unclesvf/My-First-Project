      "narration": "By the early 1900s, the suffrage movement split into two organizations with different strategies. The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), led by Carrie Chapman Catt, pursued a state-by-state strategy. They lobbied state legislatures to grant women voting rights, believing success at the state level would build momentum for a federal amendment. Wyoming granted women's suffrage in 1869, followed by Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and eventually fifteen states by 1914.",

But the combination of NAWSA's lobbying, the NWP's protests, and women's contributions to the war effort changed his mind. During World War I, women took jobs in factories, served as nurses, sold war bonds, and managed farms while men fought overseas. They proved they could handle responsibilities traditionally reserved for men.",
