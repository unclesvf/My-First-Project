## QUIZ EXPANSION PROJECT

### Issue Identified
Many lessons currently have only 3 quiz questions. Target is 8 questions per lesson to provide comprehensive assessment.

### Lessons Needing Quiz Expansion (3→8 questions)

**Already Verified as Needing Expansion:**
- Lesson 27: Trail of Tears (currently 3 questions)
- Lesson 28: Nullification Crisis (currently 3 questions)
- Lesson 29: Second Great Awakening (currently 3 questions)
- Lesson 31: Manifest Destiny (currently 3 questions)
- Lesson 32: Mexican-American War (currently 3 questions)
- Lesson 33: Compromise of 1850 (currently 3 questions)
- Lesson 34: Uncle Tom's Cabin (currently 3 questions)
- Lesson 35: Kansas-Nebraska Act (currently 3 questions)
- Lesson 36: Dred Scott Decision (currently 3 questions)
- Lesson 37: Lincoln's Election & Secession (currently 3 questions)

**Need to Audit:**
- Lessons 7-50: Check each lesson's quiz array to identify all lessons with fewer than 8 questions
- Create complete list of lessons needing quiz expansion

### Quiz Expansion Guidelines

Each lesson should have **8 quiz questions** covering:
1. **Key Facts** (2-3 questions): dates, names, events
2. **Concepts** (2-3 questions): understanding ideas, movements, significance
3. **Cause & Effect** (1-2 questions): why events happened, what resulted
4. **Analysis** (1-2 questions): interpreting meaning, comparing perspectives

### Question Format
```typescript
{
  id: "qXX-#",
  question: "Clear, specific question?",
  options: [
    "Incorrect but plausible option",
    "Correct answer",
    "Incorrect but plausible option",
    "Incorrect but plausible option"
  ],
  correctOptionIndex: 1,
  explanation: "2-3 sentence explanation of why the answer is correct and providing additional context."
}
```

### Expansion Strategy
1. **Audit Phase**: Create comprehensive list of all lessons needing quiz expansion
2. **Batch Expansion**: Expand quizzes in groups of 10 lessons
3. **Quality Check**: Ensure questions are varied, clear, and educationally valuable

### Successful Patterns
- First-person teenage narrators create emotional engagement
- Including dialogue and sensory details brings history to life
- Exploring moral complexity and contradictions adds depth
- Connecting personal stories to broader historical forces works well

### Areas to Maintain
- Balance between individual experience and historical context
- Age-appropriate yet sophisticated treatment of difficult topics
- Diverse perspectives (gender, race, region, class)
- Critical thinking about American ideals vs. practices

### Quiz Expansion Priorities
1. First complete all chapter expansions (Lessons 31-50)
2. Then systematically expand quizzes to ensure comprehensive assessment
3. Aim for questions that test understanding, not just memorization
