## How to Get Image Prompts from AI

### Step 1: Upload the File
Upload `ALL-LESSONS-FULL-TEXT.md` to one of these AI assistants:
- **Grok** (X.com AI)
- **Google Gemini**
- **ChatGPT**
- **Claude** (Anthropic)

### Step 2: Use This Prompt

```
I have a 50-lesson American History course for 7th graders. I've attached
a file with the complete text of all lessons, each divided into chapters.

Please help me create detailed, historically accurate image generation
prompts for illustrating these lessons. For each chapter, suggest:

1. A vivid scene description that captures the key historical moment
2. Important visual details (clothing, setting, architecture, etc.)
3. The mood and atmosphere appropriate for the period
4. Composition suggestions for educational clarity

Start with Lesson 1, and we'll work through them systematically.
For each chapter image prompt, consider:
- Historical accuracy for 7th grade education
- Engaging visuals that bring history to life
- Diverse perspectives when appropriate
- Age-appropriate content
```

### Step 3: Work Through Lessons
The AI can read the file and help you create image prompts chapter by chapter.
The file has clear markers like:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LESSON 1 OF 50: One World to the Next
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### CHAPTER 1: The Journey Begins

[Chapter content here...]

---

### CHAPTER 2: Survival and Struggle

[Chapter content here...]
```

This makes it easy for the AI to identify and work with specific lessons and chapters.

## Alternative Approach

If the file is too large for one upload, you can:

1. Ask the AI to visit your live website: `https://auntsvaluefarm.com/history/`
2. Upload `LESSON-SUMMARY.md` first to give context
3. Then ask for specific lessons one at a time

---

## What You'll Get

For each chapter, the AI can generate prompts like:

**Example for Lesson 1, Chapter 1:**
> "A 13-year-old Spanish boy in 16th-century clothing stands on the deck of a
> wooden galleon as it approaches the Florida coast in 1565. The scene shows
> the moment of first sight of La Florida - dense green forests, strange tropical
> birds, and Timucua people visible on the shoreline. The boy's expression mixes
> fear and excitement. Warm golden afternoon light, historically accurate Spanish
> colonial period details, painted in a style suitable for educational illustration."

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Ask for specific lessons or chapters
2. **Iterate**: Refine the prompts based on what the AI generates
3. **Historical Accuracy**: Ask the AI to fact-check historical details
4. **Style Guidance**: Specify if you want realistic, illustrative, or painterly styles
5. **Batch Work**: Work through 5-10 chapters at a time for efficiency
