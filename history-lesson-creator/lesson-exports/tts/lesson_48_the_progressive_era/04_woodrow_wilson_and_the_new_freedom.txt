Chapter 4. Woodrow Wilson and the New Freedom.

Woodrow Wilson wins the presidency in 1912, running as a Progressive Democrat against Theodore Roosevelt (running as a Progressive/Bull Moose candidate) and conservative Republican William Howard Taft.

Wilson's "New Freedom" program aims to restore competition by breaking up monopolies rather than just regulating them. He achieves major reforms:

The Underwood Tariff (1913) reduces import taxes, lowering consumer prices and reducing corporate protection from foreign competition. To replace lost revenue, it establishes the first permanent federal income tax under the new Sixteenth Amendment.

The Federal Reserve Act (1913) creates a national banking system to regulate money supply, provide stability, and prevent financial panics. It's the most significant banking reform in American history.

The Clayton Antitrust Act (1914) strengthens antitrust laws, prohibiting specific practices like price discrimination and interlocking directorates. Importantly, it exempts labor unions from antitrust prosecution, allowing workers to organize and strike.

The Federal Trade Commission (1914) is created to investigate and prevent unfair business practices.

Wilson also supports the Seventeenth Amendment (1913), providing for direct election of senators by voters rather than state legislatures. This reduces corporate control over Senate elections.

Child labor laws pass, though the Supreme Court strikes them down. Wilson supports an eight-hour workday for railroad workers. He appoints Louis Brandeis, a Progressive reformer, to the Supreme Court - the first Jewish justice.

These reforms expand federal power and regulation dramatically. The Progressive Era establishes the principle that government should actively regulate the economy to protect public interest, not just let markets operate unchecked.
