Chapter 5. The Progressive Legacy - Promise and Limits.

By 1920, I'm 25 years old and still involved in reform work. The Progressive Era has transformed America in remarkable ways.

We've achieved major reforms:
• Pure Food and Drug Act protects consumers
• Antitrust laws limit monopoly power
• Conservation preserves natural resources
• Income tax and direct election of senators make government more democratic
• Labor laws improve working conditions (though child labor and long hours persist)
• Women won the vote with the Nineteenth Amendment (1920)

But the Progressive Era has serious limitations and contradictions.

Racial injustice: Most Progressives ignore or actively support segregation. Woodrow Wilson segregates federal government offices. No major Progressive reforms address racial discrimination. Black Americans are excluded from most Progressive gains.

Imperialism: Progressives who support democracy at home support empire abroad. The U.S. conquers the Philippines, intervenes in Latin America, imposes American power globally. Progressive presidents like Roosevelt and Wilson are imperialists.

Prohibition: The Eighteenth Amendment (1919) bans alcohol, a reform pushed by Progressives concerned about alcoholism and family violence. But Prohibition creates organized crime, doesn't stop drinking, and violates personal freedom. It will be repealed in 1933.

Limited labor gains: While some reforms help workers, fundamental power imbalances remain. Most workers still lack unions, work long hours for low pay, face dangerous conditions.

Still, the Progressive Era proves government can be a force for reform. It establishes that democracy requires active government protecting ordinary citizens against powerful economic interests. It shows that organized citizens demanding change can achieve it.

I think about my years at Hull House, teaching English to immigrant women, fighting for child labor laws, supporting suffrage. We didn't create a perfect society, but we made it more just. We proved that "progress" isn't automatic - it requires struggle, organization, and political will.

The Progressive Era's fundamental insight is that democracy and unregulated capitalism are incompatible. If corporations have unlimited power, they'll corrupt politics, exploit workers, and create massive inequality. Only active government regulation and social reforms can make capitalism compatible with democracy and human dignity.

That lesson remains relevant. Every generation faces the question: will government serve the powerful few or the democratic many? The Progressives showed that the answer depends on whether ordinary citizens organize and demand reform. Our legacy is proof that change is possible when people fight for it.
