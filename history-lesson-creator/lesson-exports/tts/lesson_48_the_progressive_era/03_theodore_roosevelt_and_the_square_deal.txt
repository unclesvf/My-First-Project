Chapter 3. Theodore Roosevelt and the Square Deal.

Theodore Roosevelt becomes president in 1901 when McKinley is assassinated. At 42, he's the youngest president in history. He's energetic, charismatic, and committed to Progressive reform.

Roosevelt's "Square Deal" promises fairness for workers, consumers, and businesses. He believes government should be an umpire ensuring fair play, not favoring either capital or labor.

Roosevelt is the "trust-buster," using antitrust laws to break up monopolies. In 1902, he sues Northern Securities Company, a railroad trust. The Supreme Court orders it dissolved. Roosevelt brings 44 more antitrust suits, targeting Standard Oil, American Tobacco, and other monopolies. He's not against big business, just against abusive monopolies.

The 1902 coal strike tests Roosevelt's principles. 140,000 miners strike for better wages and shorter hours. Mine owners refuse to negotiate. As winter approaches, coal shortages loom. Previous presidents would have sent troops to break the strike. Roosevelt threatens to seize the mines unless owners negotiate. Owners back down. The strike is settled with modest gains for miners.

Roosevelt champions conservation. He's an outdoorsman who loves nature. He establishes national forests, national parks, wildlife refuges, and national monuments - preserving millions of acres from development. He creates the U.S. Forest Service under Gifford Pinchot.

Roosevelt expands federal power dramatically. Before him, the federal government rarely intervened in the economy. After him, government regulation of business is accepted practice. He proves government can be a force for reform, not just protecting the wealthy.
