Chapter 1. Hull House and the Settlement Movement.

I'm Catherine, fifteen years old, and I volunteer at Hull House in Chicago. Hull House is a settlement house founded by Jane Addams in 1889. It's located in a poor immigrant neighborhood where Italian, Polish, Greek, and Russian immigrants live crowded in tenements.

Settlement houses are community centers where reformers live among the poor, offering education, social services, and advocacy. Hull House provides kindergarten for children, English classes for adults, art classes, music lessons, a public kitchen, a playground, and meeting spaces for labor unions and civic groups.

I teach English to immigrant women twice a week. Many are factory workers who speak no English. Learning the language helps them navigate American society, understand their rights, and help their children with school.

Jane Addams herself lives at Hull House. She's one of the most influential reformers in America - advocating for child labor laws, factory safety regulations, women's suffrage, and peace. She sees Hull House not as charity but as a way to address systemic problems. We don't just help individuals - we work to change the laws and conditions that create poverty.

The Progressive Era, roughly 1900-1920, is a time of reform movements addressing problems created by industrialization, urbanization, and corporate power. Progressives believe government should actively regulate business, protect workers and consumers, and promote social welfare.

We're fighting multiple battles: against child labor, for food and drug safety, for workers' rights, for women's suffrage, for direct democracy, against political corruption, for conservation of natural resources. It's an exciting, hopeful time - we believe we can make America more just and democratic.
