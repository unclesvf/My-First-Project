Chapter 5. The Battle of New Orleans.

The war's strangest moment came in January 1815. Andrew Jackson, commanding American forces in New Orleans, faced a battle British army. On January 8, British troops in neat formations charged American positions behind cotton bales and earthworks.

It was a slaughter. American rifles and cannons cut down wave after wave of British soldiers. In 30 minutes, over 2,000 British were killed or wounded, including their commanding general. American casualties were fewer than 100. It was one of the most lopsided victories in military history.

Jackson became a national hero. The victory proved Americans could defeat British regulars in open battle. It erased the shame of earlier defeats and the burning of Washington. Americans celebrated wildly - we'd beaten Britain!

But there was a terrible irony: the battle was fought two weeks after the Treaty of Ghent ended the war. News traveled so slowly that neither side knew peace had been signed. Over 2,000 men died in a battle that didn't need to happen, fighting for a war that was already over.

The Battle of New Orleans didn't change the war's outcome - the treaty was already signed. But it changed American psychology. We'd ended the war with a spectacular victory, not a whimper. Andrew Jackson became a symbol of American toughness. The West had saved the nation where the East had failed. These shifts would reshape American politics for decades.
