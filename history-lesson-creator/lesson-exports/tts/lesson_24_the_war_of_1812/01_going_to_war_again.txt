Chapter 1. Going to War Again.

I'm Daniel, sixteen, and we're at war with Britain again. The reasons are complicated: Britain's been stopping our ships, searching them, and forcing American sailors to serve in the British navy - "impressment," they call it. Britain aids Native tribes fighting American expansion. Americans want to seize Canada. "War Hawks" in Congress pushed for war despite our weak military.

The war isn't going well. We tried to invade Canada and failed. Britain's navy blockades our coast. Our economy suffers. Many Federalists oppose the war, especially in New England where merchants lose money. Some even talk of secession - leaving the Union!

In August 1814, British troops invaded Washington D.C., burning the Capitol and White House. President Madison fled. It was humiliating. Now British ships are attacking Baltimore, where I live. We're determined to defend Fort McHenry in our harbor.
