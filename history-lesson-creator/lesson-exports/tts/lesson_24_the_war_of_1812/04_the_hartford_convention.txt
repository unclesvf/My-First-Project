Chapter 4. The Hartford Convention.

Three months after we defended Baltimore, in December 1814, New England Federalists met in Hartford, Connecticut. They opposed the war from the beginning - it hurt their shipping trade with Britain. Some talked openly of New England leaving the Union.

The Hartford Convention proposed constitutional amendments to limit federal power: require two-thirds vote to declare war, admit new states, or restrict trade. They wanted to protect New England's interests against the South and West. Some delegates whispered about secession if their demands weren't met.

Father was furious. "The country's at war, and they're threatening to break apart? That's treason!" He saw the Convention as selfish New England merchants putting profits above patriotism.

But the Convention's timing proved disastrous. As they debated, news arrived: we'd defended Baltimore, defeated the British at Plattsburgh, New York, and - most incredibly - Andrew Jackson had crushed a British invasion at New Orleans! The war was ending in American victories.

Then came news of the Treaty of Ghent - peace! The Hartford Convention suddenly looked foolish and unpatriotic. They'd threatened secession just as America was winning. The Federalist Party never recovered. They appeared to be traitors who'd opposed a successful war. Within a few years, the Federalist Party died.
