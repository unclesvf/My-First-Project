Chapter 3. The Burning of Washington.

August 1814 brought America's darkest moment in the war. A British force marched on Washington D.C., our nation's capital. Our militia tried to stop them at Bladensburg, Maryland, but we broke and ran - soldiers call it the "Bladensburg Races."

British troops entered Washington unopposed. They burned the Capitol building, where Congress meets. They burned the White House, forcing President and Dolley Madison to flee. Dolley saved important documents and a portrait of George Washington before escaping. The British burned the Treasury, War Department, and other government buildings.

My uncle was there. He described the horror: "The British took revenge for our burning of York in Canada. They methodically destroyed our government buildings. But they spared private homes and didn't loot. It was military destruction, not mob violence. Still, seeing our capital burn while our government fled was humiliating beyond words."

The burning of Washington shocked Americans. How could we let the enemy reach our capital? Where was our army? Some newspapers called for Madison's resignation. Federalists said the war was foolish from the start. But most Americans felt anger and determination - we would not surrender.

The British expected the burning to break American will. Instead, it strengthened our resolve. When they moved on Baltimore, they found us ready to fight. We wouldn't let them burn another city. The humiliation of Washington turned into the determination that saved Fort McHenry.
