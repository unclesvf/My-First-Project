Chapter 2. The Star-Spangled Banner.

All night on September 13-14, 1814, British ships bombarded Fort McHenry. I watched from the city as "rockets' red glare" and "bombs bursting in air" lit up the darkness. Would the fort surrender? Could it hold?

At dawn, through the smoke, we saw it: our flag still flew over the fort! We'd held. The British gave up the attack. We'd defended our city!

A lawyer named Francis Scott Key watched the battle from a ship. So moved by the flag's survival, he wrote a poem: "The Star-Spangled Banner." It captured our determination - battered but unbowed, our flag still waved. His poem became our national anthem.

The war ended with the Treaty of Ghent in December 1814. Nothing really changed - no territory exchanged, no major concessions. But we'd stood up to Britain again. We'd defended our sovereignty. This "Second War for Independence" proved America would survive.
