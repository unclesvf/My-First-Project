Chapter 2. Whose Land?.

But the land isn't empty. We've passed through territories of the Pawnee, Sioux, Shoshone, and dozens of other Native nations. They watch our wagon trains from hills, sometimes trading with us, sometimes just observing. We're crossing their homeland without permission, hunting their buffalo, using their water, cutting their trees for firewood.

Father tries to trade fairly when we encounter Native peoples. Some pioneers treat them with respect. But others are hostile, seeing them as obstacles to American progress. I've heard men in our train talk about Natives as "savages" who don't deserve the land because they don't farm it in European ways.

This troubles me. The Natives we've met are skilled hunters, have complex societies, follow migration patterns refined over centuries. They use the land differently than we do, but they clearly own it and depend on it. When we claim Oregon as empty land ready for settlement, we're erasing the people who've lived there for thousands of years.

I asked Father about this. He sighed and said, "Son, America needs land for its growing population. We believe our way of life - farming, democracy, Christianity - is superior and destined to spread. But you're right to feel uncomfortable. Manifest Destiny gives us a noble-sounding justification for taking what belongs to others. History will judge whether we're heroes or thieves."
