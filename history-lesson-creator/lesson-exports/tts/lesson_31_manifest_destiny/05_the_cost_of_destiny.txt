Chapter 5. The Cost of Destiny.

Manifest Destiny has given America vast new territory. Oregon, Texas, and soon California and the Southwest will add millions of acres to the nation. Americans are flooding west, building farms, towns, eventually states. The nation is growing wealthy and powerful.

But the costs are staggering. Native peoples are being displaced everywhere. The Cherokee's Trail of Tears is just the beginning - soon the Plains tribes, the Southwest tribes, the Pacific Northwest tribes will all face removal, war, or confinement to reservations. An entire continent's indigenous peoples are being dispossessed in the name of American expansion.

Mexico will lose half its territory in the coming war. The Californios, Tejanos, and other Mexicans living in those territories will become Americans overnight, often losing their land through legal chicanery despite treaty promises. Their culture and language will be marginalized in what was once their homeland.

Most troubling is what this expansion does to our slavery crisis. Every new territory raises the question: will it be slave or free? Oregon has chosen free. But Texas is slave. What about the territories we'll take from Mexico? The Missouri Compromise divided Louisiana Purchase territories at 36°30'. But that doesn't apply to these new lands. We'll have to fight this battle again and again.

Standing on our Oregon claim, looking at the land we've worked so hard to reach, I understand the appeal of Manifest Destiny. We've created opportunity for our family, claimed land for farming, extended American democracy westward. This is the promise of the West - a fresh start, abundant land, freedom to build the life you choose.

But I also see the darker truth: Manifest Destiny is a beautiful phrase for conquest. We've taken this land from people who lived here first. We've provoked war with Mexico to seize more. We're spreading not just democracy but also slavery's curse. And we're planting the seeds of future conflicts - between North and South over slavery's expansion, between settlers and Natives over land, between the ideal of equality and the practice of exclusion.

America is fulfilling its destiny to span the continent. But destiny, I'm learning, is a word we use to make conquest sound noble. The land we've gained is real. So is the blood on our hands. Future generations will have to decide whether the cost was worth it, whether Manifest Destiny was divine providence or national greed. I fear I know the answer.
