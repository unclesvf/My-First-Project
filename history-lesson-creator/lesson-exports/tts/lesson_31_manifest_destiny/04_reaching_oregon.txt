Chapter 4. Reaching Oregon.

After six months, we finally reach Oregon's Willamette Valley. The land is beautiful - green, fertile, watered by rain. We claim 640 acres under Oregon's provisional land laws. It's ours if we farm it and improve it. We've traveled 2,000 miles for this moment.

Building our homestead is backbreaking work. We clear land, build a cabin, plant crops. Our nearest neighbors are miles away. Winters are wet and mild compared to Missouri, but loneliness is hard. Mother misses her family, her church, her friends. We've gained land but lost community.

More wagon trains arrive constantly. Oregon is filling with Americans, and we're organizing territorial government. We've banned slavery - most Oregonians are farmers who don't want to compete with slave labor. But we've also passed laws excluding free Black people from living here. Oregon's vision of freedom is selective.

As I work our land, I think about the Native peoples who lived here before us. They're being pushed out, their villages abandoned, their salmon fishing sites taken over. We call this progress - transforming "wilderness" into farms and towns. But I can't shake the feeling that we're destroying a way of life that worked for thousands of years.
