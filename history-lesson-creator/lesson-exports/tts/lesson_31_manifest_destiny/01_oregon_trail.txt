Chapter 1. Oregon Trail.

I'm Samuel, sixteen, and our family has been on the Oregon Trail for six months. We left Independence, Missouri in the spring of 1846 with everything we owned packed into a covered wagon. Two thousand miles of prairie, mountains, rivers, and desert separate us from Oregon's Willamette Valley.

The journey is harder than anyone imagined. We wake before dawn, travel until dusk, covering maybe fifteen miles a day if we're lucky. We've buried three people from our wagon train - cholera, accident, childbirth. Mother keeps a tight grip on my younger siblings, terrified of losing anyone.

The landscape is beautiful and terrifying. Endless prairie grass, buffalo herds darkening the horizon, thunderstorms that shake our wagon. We crossed the Platte River, climbed through South Pass in the Rockies, and descended into the harsh desert beyond. Every step west is a step into the unknown.

Journalist John O'Sullivan calls this "Manifest Destiny" - the idea that God intended America to span the continent from Atlantic to Pacific. President Polk echoes this, saying it's America's divine mission to spread democracy and civilization across North America. Many in our wagon train believe this. They see Oregon as a promised land, empty and waiting for Americans to claim it.
