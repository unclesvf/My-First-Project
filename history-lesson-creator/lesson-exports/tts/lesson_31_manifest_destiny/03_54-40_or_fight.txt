Chapter 3. 54-40 or Fight.

Oregon itself is disputed territory. Britain and America both claim it through competing treaties and exploration. The boundary hasn't been settled. Some Americans demand all of Oregon up to the 54°40' north latitude - the southern border of Russian Alaska. "54-40 or Fight!" is the slogan. They're willing to go to war with Britain for every inch of Oregon.

President Polk campaigned on aggressive expansion. He's already annexed Texas in 1845, angering Mexico. Now he's negotiating with Britain over Oregon while preparing for possible war with Mexico over the Texas boundary and California.

The tension is real. Britain has the world's most powerful navy. War with them would be devastating. But many Americans are land-hungry, believing the continent is rightfully ours. Compromise seems weak to them - they want all the territory America can seize.

In the end, Polk compromises with Britain at the 49th parallel - the current U.S.-Canada border. We get the southern part of Oregon (present-day Oregon, Washington, Idaho). Britain keeps the northern part (British Columbia). The "54-40 or Fight" crowd is disappointed, but war is avoided. We've gained enormous territory without fighting Britain.

But Polk won't compromise with Mexico. He wants California and New Mexico, and he's willing to provoke war to get them. Manifest Destiny, it seems, applies differently depending on the opponent's strength.
