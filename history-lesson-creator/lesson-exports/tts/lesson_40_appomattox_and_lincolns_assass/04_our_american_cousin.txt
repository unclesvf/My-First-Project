Chapter 4. Our American Cousin.

April 14, 1865. Good Friday. Five days after Appomattox, the war essentially over. President Lincoln was in good spirits. Richmond had fallen. Lee had surrendered. The Union was preserved. Slavery would be abolished - the Thirteenth Amendment was making its way through the states.

That evening, Lincoln went to Ford's Theatre in Washington to see a play: "Our American Cousin," a popular comedy. He brought his wife Mary and two guests. They sat in the presidential box overlooking the stage.

The theater was crowded. People were celebrating the war's end. The play was funny, and the audience laughed. Lincoln laughed too, finally able to relax after four years of terrible burdens.

At 10:15 p.m., during the third act, John Wilkes Booth entered the presidential box. Booth was an actor, a Confederate sympathizer, and a man consumed by hatred of Lincoln. He believed Lincoln was a tyrant who'd destroyed the South.

Booth shot Lincoln in the back of the head with a derringer pistol. Lincoln slumped forward, unconscious. Booth jumped from the box to the stage, shouting "Sic semper tyrannis!" (Thus always to tyrants). He fled the theater.

Doctors carried Lincoln to a house across the street. The bullet had entered his brain. There was no hope of recovery. Lincoln's cabinet and family gathered around his bedside. He never regained consciousness.

At 7:22 a.m. on April 15, Abraham Lincoln died. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

The news spread through Washington, then the nation. People who'd been celebrating the war's end now mourned. The man who'd preserved the Union, freed the slaves, and sought reconciliation with the South - killed just as peace arrived.

Booth was hunted down and killed twelve days later. His co-conspirators - he'd planned to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward as well - were captured and hanged. But the damage was done. Lincoln was gone.
