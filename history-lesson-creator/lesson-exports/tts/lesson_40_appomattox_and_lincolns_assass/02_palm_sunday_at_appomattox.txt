Chapter 2. Palm Sunday at Appomattox.

April 9, 1865. Palm Sunday. We woke to news that Confederate forces blocked Lee's retreat route. Lee's army was surrounded. He had perhaps 28,000 hungry, exhausted men. Grant had over 100,000 fresh troops.

That morning, Lee attempted one final breakout. Confederate cavalry attacked Union lines blocking the road west. For a moment, it looked like they might break through. Then Union infantry reinforcements arrived. Lee's escape was impossible.

Around 8:30 a.m., a Confederate officer rode out under a white flag, requesting a truce to discuss terms. Lee would surrender.

The officers chose the home of Wilmer McLean for the surrender meeting. By strange coincidence, McLean had lived near Manassas in 1861 - the first Battle of Bull Run was fought on his property. He'd moved to Appomattox to escape the war. Now the war was ending in his parlor.

Grant arrived around 1:30 p.m., muddy from hard riding. Lee was there in his finest uniform. The contrast was striking: the Confederate commander immaculate in defeat, the Union commander travel-worn in victory.

They talked briefly about old army days - both had served in the Mexican-American War. Then they discussed terms. Lee asked what Grant proposed.

Grant's terms were generous. Confederate soldiers would surrender their weapons but could keep their horses - they'd need them for spring planting. Officers could keep their sidearms. No one would be tried for treason. Soldiers could go home, and as long as they obeyed the law, they wouldn't be bothered by U.S. authorities.

Lee accepted. He asked if cavalrymen and artillerymen - who owned their own horses in the Confederate army - could keep them. Grant agreed immediately. "Let all the men who claim to own a horse or mule take the animals home with them to work their little farms," Grant said.

Lee signed the surrender document. Four years of war ended in that moment.
