Chapter 1. The Final Campaign.

I'm Daniel, sixteen years old, and I've been a Union soldier for two years. I enlisted in 1863 after the Emancipation Proclamation. The war had become a crusade to end slavery, and I wanted to be part of it.

By early 1865, the war's end was approaching. General Ulysses S. Grant commanded all Union armies. He'd been promoted after his victories at Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Grant understood that the Union's advantages - more men, more industry, more supplies - would win a war of attrition. He launched coordinated campaigns against Confederate armies across multiple fronts.

In Virginia, Grant pursued Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia relentlessly. No more cautious McClellan-style retreats after battles. Grant fought Lee continuously - the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor - then moved south, forcing Lee to defend Richmond and Petersburg.

The fighting was brutal. At Cold Harbor in June 1864, we assaulted Confederate entrenchments and lost 7,000 men in under an hour. Grant was criticized for the casualties, but he kept pressing Lee, knowing the Confederacy couldn't replace its losses.

Meanwhile, General William Sherman marched through Georgia, capturing Atlanta in September 1864, then marching to the sea. His army destroyed Confederate infrastructure - railroads, factories, warehouses. Sherman's March showed the Confederacy couldn't protect its own territory.

By spring 1865, Lee's army was trapped in Petersburg, besieged by Grant's forces. The Confederate army was starving, depleted, and demoralized. Deserters fled daily. On April 2, Grant broke through Petersburg's defenses. Lee evacuated Richmond - the Confederate capital fell.

Lee retreated west, hoping to join Confederate forces in North Carolina. Grant pursued. We marched hard, cutting off Lee's escape routes, forcing him toward a small Virginia town: Appomattox Court House.
