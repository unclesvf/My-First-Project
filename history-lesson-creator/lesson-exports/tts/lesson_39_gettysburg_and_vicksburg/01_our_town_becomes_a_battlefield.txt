Chapter 1. Our Town Becomes a Battlefield.

I'm Sarah, fifteen years old, and I live in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It's a small town - just 2,400 people - where ten roads meet. We have a Lutheran seminary, a college, farms, shops. It's a peaceful place. Or it was, until July 1863.

June brought rumors of Confederate invasion. General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was marching north through Maryland into Pennsylvania. People were frightened. Some families fled. Others stayed, hoping the armies would pass us by.

June 30. Confederate soldiers appeared on the Chambersburg Pike, west of town. They were foraging for supplies - shoes, food, horses. They didn't stay long, but they'd be back.

July 1 dawned hot and clear. I woke to the sound of distant gunfire. Confederate and Union cavalry were fighting west of town. Then infantry arrived - thousands of soldiers in gray and blue converging on Gettysburg from different roads.

Mother told me to stay in the cellar. From the small window, I could see soldiers running through our streets. Artillery shells exploded. Buildings caught fire. The battle spread through town.

By afternoon, Union forces retreated through Gettysburg to Cemetery Hill, a rise south of town. Confederates pursued, capturing thousands of Union soldiers. Our house became a Confederate aid station. Wounded men filled every room. The carpets soaked with blood. Surgeons amputated limbs on our kitchen table while I helped tend the wounded.

That night, more Union forces arrived - the rest of General George Meade's Army of the Potomac. They took positions on Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and two rocky hills called Little Round Top and Big Round Top. The Confederates held the town and Seminary Ridge, west of Cemetery Ridge.

One hundred sixty thousand soldiers now surrounded Gettysburg. Two massive armies facing each other across open fields. And our town was caught in the middle.
