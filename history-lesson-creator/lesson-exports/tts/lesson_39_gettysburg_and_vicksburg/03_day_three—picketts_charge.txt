Chapter 3. Day Three - Pickett's Charge.

July 3, 1863. The third day of battle. The day Gettysburg became the war's turning point.

The morning was relatively quiet - just scattered skirmishing. Then, at 1 p.m., the Confederate artillery opened up. Over 150 cannons bombarded the Union center on Cemetery Ridge. The noise was unimaginable - constant explosions for nearly two hours. Our house shook. Plaster fell from the ceiling. We huddled in the cellar, praying.

The Union artillery answered. The cannonade was the largest of the war - over 300 cannons firing. The sound must have been heard fifty miles away.

Then, around 3 p.m., the guns quieted. An eerie silence fell. From our cellar window, I saw what happened next.

Fifteen thousand Confederate soldiers emerged from the woods on Seminary Ridge. They formed battle lines - a mile-wide formation in perfect order. Then they began marching across the open fields toward Cemetery Ridge, three-quarters of a mile away.

It was called Pickett's Charge, though three divisions participated, not just George Pickett's. The Confederates advanced slowly, steadily, in parade-ground formation. They looked magnificent and doomed.

Union artillery opened fire. Shells tore gaps in the Confederate ranks. The men closed the gaps and kept marching. Union infantry waited behind a stone wall on Cemetery Ridge. When the Confederates came within rifle range, the Union line erupted in fire.

The slaughter was terrible. Confederate soldiers fell by hundreds, then thousands. Some reached the stone wall - the "High Water Mark of the Confederacy," it's called now. For a few minutes, Confederate soldiers broke through the Union line in hand-to-hand fighting. Then Union reinforcements pushed them back.

The survivors retreated across the blood-soaked field, leaving thousands of dead and wounded behind. Of the 15,000 who charged, fewer than half returned. Pickett's division was destroyed - three brigade commanders killed, all thirteen regimental commanders killed or wounded.

General Lee met the survivors. "It's all my fault," he said. He expected a Union counterattack, but it never came. Meade's army was too battered to pursue.
