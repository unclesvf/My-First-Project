Chapter 2. Day Two - Little Round Top.

July 2. The second day of battle was even more terrible than the first. The fighting shifted south to the Round Tops - rocky, wooded hills at the end of the Union line.

From our cellar, we heard continuous artillery fire. The explosions shook the house. Between bombardments, we heard rifle volleys - thousands of guns firing together - and the screams of wounded men.

A Union soldier who took shelter in our cellar briefly told us what was happening. Confederates were attacking the Union left flank, trying to capture Little Round Top. If they took that hill, they could place artillery there and destroy the Union line on Cemetery Ridge.

Union Colonel Joshua Chamberlain defended Little Round Top with the 20th Maine regiment. They fought for hours, running out of ammunition. Finally, with Confederates charging up the hill and no bullets left, Chamberlain ordered a bayonet charge down the hill. The desperate attack surprised the Confederates and drove them back.

Little Round Top remained in Union hands - barely. If it had fallen, the entire Union position might have collapsed.

Meanwhile, fighting raged at other points: the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, Devil's Den. Thousands of men fought and died in our farm fields. Each location changed hands multiple times.

That evening, the guns finally quieted. Both armies held their positions, exhausted. Our cellar flooded with more wounded. Confederate and Union soldiers lay side by side, too hurt to care which army they belonged to. I gave them water, held their hands, wrote letters home for those who could speak.

One Confederate boy - he couldn't have been older than seventeen - asked me to write to his mother in Georgia. "Tell her I was brave," he said. "Tell her I wasn't scared." He died before dawn. I still have the letter I never sent.

Two days of battle. Thousands dead. And everyone knew the third day would be worse.
