Chapter 5. Vicksburg - The River Runs Free.

The same day Lee retreated from Gettysburg - July 4, 1863 - another momentous victory occurred a thousand miles away. Vicksburg, Mississippi, surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant after a 47-day siege.

We learned about it days later through the newspapers. The news was almost as important as Gettysburg, though it felt distant from our Pennsylvania town.

Vicksburg sat on high bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. Confederates called it the "Gibraltar of the Confederacy." As long as they held Vicksburg, they controlled a crucial stretch of the Mississippi, keeping the Confederacy connected between east and west.

Grant had tried for months to capture Vicksburg through conventional attacks. All failed. So he changed strategy. He marched his army south along the west bank of the Mississippi, crossed below Vicksburg, then circled behind the city, cutting it off from supplies and reinforcements.

Confederate General John Pemberton had 30,000 troops in Vicksburg. Rather than risk losing them in battle, he retreated into the city's fortifications. Grant besieged the city, bombarding it with artillery and digging trenches closer and closer to Confederate lines.

For 47 days, Vicksburg's civilians and soldiers endured constant bombardment. They dug caves in the hillsides to escape the shells. Food ran out - they ate horses, mules, even rats. Disease spread. Finally, on July 4, Pemberton surrendered.

The Mississippi River now belonged to the Union. The Confederacy was cut in half. Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas were isolated from the rest of the Confederate states. Supplies and troops from these western states could no longer reach the eastern armies.

President Lincoln said, "The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea." The river that had been contested for two years now flowed freely under Union control.

Together, Gettysburg and Vicksburg marked the war's turning point. Before July 1863, Confederate victory was possible. After, it became a matter of when, not if, the Union would win.

But the war ground on. Lee's army, though defeated at Gettysburg, remained dangerous. The Confederacy fought desperately for nearly two more years. More men would die, more towns would be destroyed, before the war finally ended. But here in Gettysburg, in early July 1863, we witnessed the moment when the tide turned - when the Union began winning a war that would preserve the nation and end slavery.
