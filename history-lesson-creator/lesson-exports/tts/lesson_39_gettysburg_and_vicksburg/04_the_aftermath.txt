Chapter 4. The Aftermath.

July 4. Lee's army began retreating to Virginia. The Battle of Gettysburg was over. The Confederacy had lost.

The carnage was unimaginable. Fifty-one thousand men killed, wounded, or missing in three days. Seven thousand dead horses rotting in the summer heat. Every house, barn, and church in Gettysburg filled with wounded. The field hospitals overwhelmed.

For weeks, we cared for the wounded. My mother and I tended dozens of soldiers in our home. Some recovered. Many died. We buried them in our garden because the graveyards filled up.

The smell was terrible - decomposing bodies, gangrene, disease. The town hired workers to bury the dead and burn the horse carcasses. It took weeks. Gettysburg would never be the same.

In November, President Lincoln came to dedicate a national cemetery for the soldiers who died here. Edward Everett, a famous orator, spoke for two hours. Then Lincoln stood and spoke for just two minutes.

I was there, in the crowd. Lincoln's words were simple but powerful: "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

He said we were fighting to ensure "that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." He made the war about more than just preserving the Union - it was about preserving democracy itself and fulfilling the promise that all men are created equal.

The Gettysburg Address lasted just 272 words, but it redefined the war's meaning. We weren't just fighting to preserve the Union. We were fighting for the principle of human equality.

Gettysburg cost us dearly, but it stopped Lee's invasion and broke the Confederacy's offensive power. Lee would never again invade the North. The war would continue nearly two more years, but after Gettysburg, Confederate victory became impossible.
