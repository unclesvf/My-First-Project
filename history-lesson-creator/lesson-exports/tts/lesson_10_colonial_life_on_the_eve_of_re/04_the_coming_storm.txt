Chapter 4. The Coming Storm.

Last week, news arrived that makes Father worried. Britain has huge debts from the French and Indian War - over £140 million. Parliament plans to raise taxes on the colonies to help pay for it. They'll station 10,000 troops here and expect us to help pay their costs.

Father says this violates a fundamental principle: we're British subjects with rights. One of those rights is that we can only be taxed by our own representatives. We have no representatives in Parliament. "No taxation without representation," Father calls it.

At the coffeehouse, men debate what this means. Some say we should accept whatever Parliament decides - they're our mother country. Others, like Father, argue that rights are rights. If Parliament can tax us without our consent, what other rights might they take away?

I don't fully understand the coming conflict, but I sense we're at a turning point. We've grown up in these decades of peace and prosperity. We've developed our own ways, our own ideas about liberty and rights. We've built a society that's distinctly American.

Britain sees us as colonists who exist to serve the empire. But we're beginning to see ourselves differently - as people with rights, capable of governing ourselves, with our own destiny to shape. The question is whether Britain and the colonies can reconcile these different visions. From the worried conversations in Father's shop, I suspect the answer is no. A storm is coming, and I fear it will change everything.
