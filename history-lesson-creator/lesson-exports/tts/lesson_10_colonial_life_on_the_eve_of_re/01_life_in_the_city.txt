Chapter 1. Life in the City.

My name is Rachel, and I am fifteen years old. I live in Philadelphia, the largest city in the colonies with over 20,000 people. Our city has paved streets, brick buildings, street lamps, and a bustling port. It's a world away from the frontier settlements Father tells stories about.

Father owns a printing shop where we produce newspapers, books, almanacs, and pamphlets. I've learned to set type and operate the press - unusual for a girl, but Father believes women should be educated. Our shop is a gathering place where men discuss politics, philosophy, and the latest news from London.

Philadelphia has theaters, coffeehouses, libraries, and schools. We have skilled craftsmen: silversmiths, cabinetmakers, wigmakers, tailors. The streets are filled with people speaking different languages - English, German, Dutch, French. We have Quakers, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Catholics, and Jews all living together.

But even in this prosperous city, I see inequality everywhere. Wealthy merchants live in mansions with servants. Indentured servants work for years to pay off their passage. And despite Pennsylvania's Quaker ideals, enslaved Africans work in homes and businesses. The contradiction troubles me - we speak of liberty while denying it to others.
