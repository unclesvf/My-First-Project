Chapter 2. Education and Ideas.

Education matters greatly to colonists, though it varies by region and class. In New England, towns fund public schools because Puritans believe everyone should read the Bible. The Middle Colonies have private schools and academies. The South educates wealthy children with private tutors, while poor children receive little formal education.

We have six colleges now: Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, Princeton, King's College in New York, and our own College of Philadelphia. They train ministers, lawyers, and gentlemen. But most learning happens through apprenticeships - boys learn trades by working with master craftsmen, just as I learned printing from Father.

Books and newspapers connect us to a wider world of ideas. We read about Enlightenment philosophers like John Locke, who wrote about natural rights and government by consent. We discuss reason, science, and progress. These ideas are revolutionary - if people have natural rights, can kings truly rule by divine right?

Father's print shop buzzes with these debates. Ben Franklin, whom Father knows, says common people can improve themselves through education and hard work. This is radical stuff - the idea that birth doesn't determine your place in society, that ordinary people can think and govern themselves. These ideas are shaping how we see ourselves and our relationship to Britain.
