Chapter 3. Different Regions, Shared Identity.

Despite our differences, a shared colonial identity is emerging. We're beginning to see ourselves not just as Virginians or New Yorkers, but as Americans - distinct from the British.

Trade connects us. New England ships carry grain from the Middle Colonies and tobacco from the South. We read each other's newspapers. We've fought together in wars. We share the experience of building new lives in a new land.

Yet deep divisions remain. The North's economy relies increasingly on trade and small farms, while the South depends on plantation slavery. Urban colonists have different concerns than frontier settlers. Wealthy merchants have little in common with struggling farmers. These divisions will haunt us for centuries.

Religious diversity is both a strength and a source of tension. In New England, Congregationalists dominate. The Middle Colonies have religious tolerance. The South has the Anglican Church. Catholics and Jews face discrimination everywhere. Yet this diversity teaches us to live with differences - a lesson that will prove valuable.

By 1763, we number about two million people in thirteen colonies. We're no longer a collection of struggling outposts - we're a thriving society with our own character, interests, and ideas. We still consider ourselves British subjects, but we're different from people in Britain. That difference will soon become impossible to ignore.
