Chapter 1. Promises Kept.

I'm Jacob, sixteen, working at a newspaper in Philadelphia. Today we received news: the Bill of Rights has been ratified! The first ten amendments to the Constitution are now law, protecting our fundamental freedoms.

During the ratification debates, Anti-Federalists feared the Constitution gave too much power to the federal government without protecting individual rights. Federalists promised to add these protections. James Madison kept that promise, drafting amendments and pushing them through Congress.

The First Amendment protects what matters most to my work: freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly, and petition. My master says we can now criticize the government without fear of punishment. We can print what we believe is true. This is revolutionary - in most countries, criticizing the government leads to arrest.
