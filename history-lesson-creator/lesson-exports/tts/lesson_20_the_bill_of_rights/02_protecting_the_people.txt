Chapter 2. Protecting the People.

The other amendments protect us in different ways. The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms. The Third says government can't force us to house soldiers. The Fourth protects against unreasonable searches - authorities need warrants based on probable cause.

Amendments Five through Eight protect people accused of crimes: the right to remain silent, to a trial by jury, to a speedy and public trial, to confront witnesses, to have a lawyer. No excessive bail or cruel punishment. These rights come from bitter experience with British tyranny.

The Ninth Amendment says that listing these rights doesn't mean we don't have others. The Tenth says powers not given to the federal government belong to states or the people. These acknowledge that government power is limited and rights are broad.

We've created something remarkable: a government with built-in protections for the people's liberties. These aren't gifts from rulers - they're limitations on government power, recognizing that rights come from being human, not from government.
