Chapter 3. Freedom of the Press.

As a printer's apprentice, the First Amendment means everything to me. Before these protections, criticizing government could land you in jail. In Britain, the Crown licenses printing presses and censors publications. Seditious libel laws punish anyone who criticizes the government, even if what they say is true.

Here in America, we've taken a different path. The First Amendment says "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." My master explains this means the government can't shut down newspapers for publishing uncomfortable truths or unpopular opinions.

This freedom isn't unlimited - we can still be sued for libel if we knowingly print falsehoods that harm someone. But the government can't censor us or require us to get permission before publishing. The people have a right to know what their government is doing, and the press has a duty to inform them.

I've watched my master agonize over articles criticizing government policies. "This could get us in trouble," he says, then prints it anyway. "But this is why we have the First Amendment. A free press is essential to keeping government honest. If they can silence us, democracy dies in darkness." That responsibility feels heavy on my shoulders as I set the type, but I understand why it matters. We're not just printers - we're guardians of the public's right to know.
