Chapter 5. A Living Promise.

The Bill of Rights has been ratified, but my master says the real work is just beginning. These amendments are words on paper. They only mean something if we defend them, if courts enforce them, if citizens demand them.

"Rights aren't self-executing," he tells me as we print copies of the Bill of Rights to sell. "Every generation must fight to preserve these liberties. Governments always want more power. Fear and crisis will tempt people to trade freedom for security. Your generation will face different threats than ours, and you'll have to decide whether these rights still matter."

He points to the First Amendment. "This one will be tested constantly. When someone publishes something offensive or dangerous, people will want to silence them. You'll have to remember that protecting unpopular speech is how we protect all speech. When you only defend speech you agree with, you don't believe in free speech at all."

I think about what he's saying. The Bill of Rights promises that government can't take our fundamental freedoms. But promises can be broken. Laws can be ignored. Rights exist only when people stand up for them, when judges protect them, when citizens refuse to let them be eroded.

We print thousands of copies of the Bill of Rights. People buy them to hang in their homes, to read to their children, to remember what makes America different. We're the first nation to build protection of individual rights into our fundamental law. We've created something unprecedented: a government that acknowledges limits on its own power.

As I set the final letters in the press - "Congress shall make no law" - I feel the weight of those words. This isn't just a legal document. It's a promise to every American, present and future, that certain freedoms are sacred and untouchable. Whether we keep that promise depends on us. The Bill of Rights gives us the tools to stay free. Using those tools is our responsibility.
