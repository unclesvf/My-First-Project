Chapter 1. A Book That Changed America.

I'm Rebecca, fourteen years old, living in Boston. Everyone in my family is reading Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe. The novel was published this year, 1852, and it's become the most talked-about book in America.

Mother bought a copy last month. She read passages aloud at dinner until Father insisted on reading it himself. My older brother, studying at Harvard, says his classmates debate it constantly. Even our minister preached a sermon about it.

I finally started reading last week and couldn't put it down. The story follows enslaved people in the South: Uncle Tom, a faithful man sold away from his wife and children; Eliza, a mother who escapes across the frozen Ohio River, leaping from ice floe to ice floe with her baby to avoid slave catchers; Little Eva, a white child who befriends Uncle Tom and dies young; and Simon Legree, a cruel overseer who beats slaves and ultimately kills Uncle Tom.

Mrs. Stowe writes in the preface that slavery is a moral evil that Christians must oppose. She describes the brutality of slavery - families torn apart at auction blocks, mothers watching their children sold away, men and women whipped for trying to learn to read. She makes slavery not an abstract political issue but a human tragedy affecting real people with hopes, fears, loves, and souls.

When I finished the book, I cried. Mother cried when she read it. Even Father, who'd always said slavery was a Southern problem that didn't concern us, now calls it evil and says something must be done. That's the power of this book - it makes slavery personal, human, impossible to ignore.
