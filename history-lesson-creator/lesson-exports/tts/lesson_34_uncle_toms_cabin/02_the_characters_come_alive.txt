Chapter 2. The Characters Come Alive.

The characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin feel real to me. Uncle Tom isn't just a name in a newspaper story about slavery - he's a person I know through Mrs. Stowe's words.

Tom is deeply religious, kind, and noble. He's sold away from his family because his owner, Mr. Shelby, has debts. Tom could escape but doesn't because he gave his word. Eventually he ends up owned by Simon Legree, a cruel man who beats his slaves and forces them to work until they collapse.

Legree orders Tom to whip another slave. Tom refuses, saying he'd rather die than hurt someone. Legree beats him brutally. Tom forgives him, maintaining his Christian faith even as he's dying. His death scene made me weep.

Eliza's story is different - she's a fighter. When she learns her son Harry will be sold away from her, she runs. Slave catchers pursue her to the Ohio River. The river is frozen but breaking up, with ice chunks floating in the current. With her baby in her arms, Eliza jumps from ice floe to ice floe, leaping across freezing water while men chase her. She makes it to the free state of Ohio.

Mrs. Stowe writes other characters too: George Harris, Eliza's husband, who escapes slavery separately; Topsy, a slave girl who's never known love; Augustine St. Clare, a kind master who dies before freeing his slaves; and his daughter Eva, an angelic child who treats Tom with love and respect but dies of illness.

These aren't abstract principles - they're people. And that's why the book is changing minds across the North.
