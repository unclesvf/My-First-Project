Chapter 3. Reaction in the North.

Uncle Tom's Cabin is everywhere in the North. It's selling faster than any book in American history - 300,000 copies in the first year. Only the Bible sells more copies.

People who've never thought much about slavery can't stop talking about it now. At my school, girls discuss whether Eliza's escape was realistic. (It was based on true accounts.) In Father's office, men debate what should be done about slavery. In churches, ministers quote Mrs. Stowe and condemn slavery from their pulpits.

The book's timing is significant. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 requires Northerners to help capture escaped slaves. We've seen slave catchers in Boston, dragging Black people back to bondage while crowds protest. Mrs. Stowe's novel shows us exactly what we're sending people back to when we obey that law.

Some Northerners who'd been indifferent or even supportive of slavery now call it evil. They see the contradiction between American ideals of freedom and the reality of human bondage. They can't reconcile "all men are created equal" with families separated on auction blocks.

My friend Sarah's father, a merchant who does business with Southern cotton traders, stopped buying cotton after reading the book. "I won't profit from such evil," he said. My uncle, who'd always avoided political discussions, now attends abolitionist meetings.

Mrs. Stowe has done what decades of political speeches couldn't - she's changed hearts. By making readers care about Tom, Eliza, and the others as human beings, she's made slavery not just wrong in abstract principle but unbearable in human reality.
