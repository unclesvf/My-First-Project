Chapter 4. Southern Outrage.

The South is furious about Uncle Tom's Cabin. Southern newspapers call it lies, propaganda, and slander. They say Mrs. Stowe has never lived in the South and doesn't understand the institution of slavery.

Southern writers publish their own novels defending slavery - books with titles like Aunt Phillis's Cabin and The Planter's Northern Bride. These books depict slavery as benevolent, claiming enslaved people are happy, well-cared for, and better off than Northern factory workers. They portray slaveholders as kind Christians and abolitionists as hypocrites and troublemakers.

But even as Southerners attack the book, their reaction proves its power. If Uncle Tom's Cabin were just false propaganda, they could ignore it. Instead, they feel compelled to write elaborate defenses of slavery, which shows how threatened they are by Mrs. Stowe's narrative.

Some Southern states ban the book. Booksellers are threatened. A few brave Southerners who question slavery after reading it face social ostracism or worse. The book becomes a dividing line - Northerners embrace it, Southerners condemn it.

The sectional divide deepens. Before Uncle Tom's Cabin, many Northerners tolerated slavery as a Southern institution protected by the Constitution. Now they see it as morally wrong and call for its end. Before the book, Southerners defended slavery as a "necessary evil." Now they defend it as a "positive good" and attack anyone who questions it.

My cousin in Virginia stopped writing to me after I mentioned reading the book. Her letter was angry: "Your Mrs. Stowe knows nothing of our ways. We treat our people well. Yankees should mind their own business." We used to write weekly. Now we're silent. The book has divided not just the nation but families.
