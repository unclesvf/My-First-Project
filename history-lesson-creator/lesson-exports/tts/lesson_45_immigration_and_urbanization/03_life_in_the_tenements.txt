Chapter 3. Life in the Tenements.

We take a ferry to Manhattan and make our way to the Lower East Side, where Uncle Paolo lives. This neighborhood is called "Little Italy" - thousands of Italian immigrants live here, speaking Italian, cooking Italian food, maintaining our culture in this strange new land.

Uncle Paolo takes us to our new home: a tenement building. Tenements are cheaply built apartment buildings designed to pack as many people as possible into small spaces. Our apartment is on the fourth floor - two rooms for our family of six, sharing a toilet in the hallway with five other families. There's no running water in the apartment. We fetch water from a hallway tap and carry it in buckets.

The rooms are dark. There's one small window facing an airshaft - a narrow gap between buildings. The window lets in little light and less air. In summer, the apartment is stifling hot. In winter, we huddle around a small stove that barely keeps us warm.

We share the apartment with another family - the Russos, also from Italy. Privacy is impossible. We hear everything from neighbors above, below, and next door. The building is crowded, loud, and often violent. Fights break out. Drunken men shout at night.

But it's not all bad. The neighborhood is vibrant. Italian grocery stores, bakeries, churches. People speak Italian on the streets. We maintain our traditions even as we try to become American.

I help Mother prepare dinner - pasta with tomato sauce, bread, a little cheese. It reminds us of home. Father eats quickly, exhausted from his construction job. I tell him about my day working in a factory, and he nods, too tired to respond.

This is our life in America: hard work, poverty, crowding. But we're together, we're safe, and we have hope for something better.
