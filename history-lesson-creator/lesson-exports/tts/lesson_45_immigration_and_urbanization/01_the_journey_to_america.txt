Chapter 1. The Journey to America.

I'm Giuseppe, fourteen years old, and I'm from a small village in southern Italy. My family are peasant farmers who barely survive. The land is poor. Taxes are high. There's no future for us here. Father says America is different - there's work, opportunity, freedom. We're going to try our luck.

We traveled to Naples, then boarded a steamship bound for New York. The cheapest passage is in steerage - the bottom of the ship. We paid $30 per person, everything we had saved for years.

Steerage is horrible. Hundreds of us crammed into a dark, airless space. Bunk beds stacked three high. No privacy. The smell is awful - unwashed bodies, vomit from seasickness, the toilet overflow. We're packed so tightly that disease spreads easily. Several children die during the crossing and are buried at sea.

The crossing takes three weeks. We're fed barely edible food - watery soup, hard bread. I'm seasick the first week. Mother fears I'll die. But I survive, and eventually the ship's motion becomes bearable.

On deck, when we're allowed up for air, I meet other immigrants - Poles, Russians, Jews, Greeks. We're all fleeing poverty or persecution, seeking something better. We share stories, practice English phrases, dream about America.

Finally, one morning, we see it: the Statue of Liberty rising from New York Harbor. Father reads the inscription at Liberty's base, written by Emma Lazarus: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."

"That's us," Father says. "We're those huddled masses." Mother cries - partly from relief at surviving the journey, partly from fear of what comes next.
