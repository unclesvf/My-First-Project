Chapter 2. Ellis Island - The Gateway.

The ship anchors in New York Harbor. First-class and second-class passengers disembark immediately - wealth means your documents are accepted without question. But we steerage passengers are transferred to ferries bound for Ellis Island.

Ellis Island is the immigration station where we'll be inspected, questioned, and either admitted to America or rejected and sent back. I'm terrified. What if they don't let us in? We've spent everything to get here. There's no going back.

The Great Hall of Ellis Island is enormous and crowded. Thousands of immigrants wait in long lines, speaking dozens of languages. Interpreters shout instructions in different languages. Children cry. Adults look anxious.

First, medical inspection. Doctors examine us quickly - checking eyes, ears, throats. They're looking for diseases that would bar entry: trachoma (an eye disease), tuberculosis, mental illness. Anyone who looks sick is marked with chalk and set aside for further examination. I'm terrified I'll be marked, but the doctor passes me without comment.

Then the questioning. An inspector asks Father: "Where are you from? How much money do you have? Do you have a job waiting? Can you read?"

Father answers carefully. We're from Italy. We have $25. Uncle Paolo wrote that he'd help Father find construction work. Yes, Father can read - he learned as a boy.

The inspector stamps our papers. We're admitted to the United States of America. We passed inspection at Ellis Island - the gateway to our new life.

Some families aren't so lucky. A woman nearby is separated from her children because she has trachoma. She'll be sent back to Europe while her children stay in America with relatives. Her screams echo through the Great Hall.
