Chapter 5. The New Colossus.

By 1900, I'm twenty-two. I've lived in America eight years. I work as a skilled shoemaker now, earning better wages. My English is fluent. I'm saving to bring my cousins from Italy to join us.

America isn't what we imagined. It's harder, harsher, more discriminatory. We work longer hours in worse conditions than we hoped. Poverty is real and persistent. The promise of opportunity is real, but achieving it requires enormous struggle.

Yet we've made progress. Father bought a small house in Brooklyn - not in a tenement but an actual house with a yard. My siblings are educated - my youngest sister will attend college, impossible in Italy. We're building something here.

I think about the Statue of Liberty, that symbol of American welcome. Emma Lazarus's poem calls America "The New Colossus" - a giant welcoming the world's oppressed. Her words are carved at Liberty's base:

"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

We are those huddled masses. America did give us a chance - not an easy chance, not a fair chance always, but a chance nonetheless. We seized it through hard work, sacrifice, and persistence.

Between 1880 and 1920, over 20 million immigrants arrive in America - mostly from Southern and Eastern Europe: Italians, Poles, Russians, Jews, Greeks. We transform American cities. New York becomes the world's most diverse city. We bring our cultures, foods, traditions, and work ethic.

American cities explode in size. New York grows from 3 million to 5 million. Chicago from 1 million to 2 million. Skyscrapers rise. Subway systems are built. Cities become centers of industry, commerce, culture - and also poverty, crime, and crowding.

This is urbanization - the shift from a rural, agricultural nation to an urban, industrial one. By 1920, more Americans live in cities than on farms for the first time in our history.

Immigrants like us drive this transformation. We provide labor for factories, construction, transportation. We create ethnic neighborhoods that become economic and cultural centers. We're building modern America - a diverse, urban, industrial nation very different from the rural, Anglo-Protestant America of the nineteenth century.

The question is whether America will embrace this diversity or resist it. Will the promise of the Statue of Liberty - welcoming the world's tired, poor, huddled masses - be fulfilled? Or will nativism close the golden door? The coming decades will answer that question, as America struggles with its identity as a nation of immigrants.
