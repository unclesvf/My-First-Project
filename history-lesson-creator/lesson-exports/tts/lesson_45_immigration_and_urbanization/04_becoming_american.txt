Chapter 4. Becoming American.

Making it in America is hard. I work in a factory twelve hours a day making shoes. I earn $5 a week, which I give to Father to help pay rent and buy food. The work is boring and exhausting, but the foreman says I'm lucky to have a job - there are always more immigrants desperate for work.

I'm learning English slowly. At work, I pick up phrases. On the street, I practice with shopkeepers. I want to speak without an accent, to sound American. But it's hard. My tongue doesn't make English sounds naturally.

In school - I attend at night when I'm not working - the teacher says we must become American, not Italian-American. "Speak English, not Italian," she insists. "Learn American ways. You're Americans now."

But it's more complicated than that. In Little Italy, we maintain our identity. We speak Italian at home, celebrate Italian holidays, eat Italian food. Our culture is who we are. Yet we're also becoming American - learning the language, adopting customs, adapting to this new place.

Some people call us "wops" or "dagos" - slurs against Italians. They say we're dirty, ignorant, taking jobs from Americans. Newspapers publish cartoons showing Italians as criminals or anarchists. There's talk of restricting Italian immigration.

This is "nativism" - hostility toward immigrants by people who consider themselves "real" Americans. Never mind that their own ancestors were immigrants. They fear we'll change American culture, work for lower wages, bring crime and radicalism.

It's painful being unwanted in a country we've sacrificed everything to reach. But we persist. We work hard, save money, send our children to school. Slowly, we're building a place for ourselves in America.

My younger sister speaks English better than Italian now. She says she's American. Father is proud but also sad - we're losing our Italian identity even as we gain an American one. The melting pot doesn't just blend cultures; it also burns away parts of who we were.
