Chapter 3. Immediate Backlash.

The convention concluded with 68 women and 32 men signing the Declaration of Sentiments. We left energized, hopeful, ready to change the world. Then the newspapers arrived.

The mockery is brutal. Papers call us "insane," "unwomanly," "ridiculous." One wrote that the convention was proof women lack the judgment to participate in politics. Another suggested we should focus on being better wives and mothers rather than demanding rights. Editorial cartoons depict us as mannish, ugly, unnatural.

The clergy is even harsher. Pastors preach sermons against us, citing biblical commands for female submission. They warn that women's rights will destroy the family, corrupt morals, bring God's judgment on America. Some congregations expel women who attended or supported the convention.

Even worse is the personal cost. Many women who signed the Declaration face social ostracism. Some husbands forbid their wives from further involvement. Several women actually withdrew their signatures under pressure. One told me through tears, "I believe in our cause, but I can't afford to be unmarriageable or unemployable. I have to live in this society."

Mother is horrified I attended. Father forbids me from further involvement. "You'll ruin your reputation," they warn. "No decent man will marry you. You'll be alone and scorned." Their concern is genuine - they're right that advocating for women's rights carries real social and economic costs. But their solution - silent submission to injustice - is unacceptable to me now.
