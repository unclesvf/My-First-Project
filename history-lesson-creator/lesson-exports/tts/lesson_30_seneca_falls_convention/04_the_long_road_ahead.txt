Chapter 4. The Long Road Ahead.

Despite the backlash, I'm not discouraged. Stanton predicted opposition. "We expect opposition," she said. "All great truths face resistance. But truth eventually prevails." She's right - every reform movement faces mockery before acceptance.

The suffrage fight will be particularly long. Some convention attendees will live to see women vote in a few western territories - Wyoming will grant women suffrage in 1869. But none of us will live to see full American women's suffrage. That won't come until 1920, 72 years after Seneca Falls. The teenagers at this convention will be dead before women win the vote they demanded.

But other changes will come faster. New York will pass the Married Women's Property Act in 1848, letting married women own property. More colleges will admit women. Professional opportunities will slowly open. Each victory builds on the ones before, creating momentum.

The connection between women's rights and abolition remains strong. Many women came to feminism through antislavery work - they saw slavery's injustice and recognized parallels to women's oppression. Both were defended as "natural" hierarchies ordained by God. Both limited human potential and dignity. Both relied on denying rights to a subordinated group.

But this connection will also cause problems. After the Civil War, when the nation debates giving Black men the vote, women's rights advocates will demand votes for women too. Some abolitionists will say "This is the Negro's hour" - we must focus on Black male suffrage and address women's suffrage later. This will split the movement and embitter many women who feel betrayed by former allies.
