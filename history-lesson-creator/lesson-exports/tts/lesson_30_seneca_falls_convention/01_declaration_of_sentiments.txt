Chapter 1. Declaration of Sentiments.

I'm Charlotte, seventeen, attending the first women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized this gathering - about 300 people, including 40 men. Frederick Douglass, the great abolitionist, came to support us.

Stanton drafted a "Declaration of Sentiments" that mirrors the Declaration of Independence. She even uses its structure: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal..." It's brilliant - she's using America's founding document to indict America's treatment of women.

The Declaration lists eighteen grievances against men's tyranny over women. We can't vote. Married women have no legal existence - their property, earnings, even their children belong to their husbands. We're denied access to higher education and most professions. We're paid less than men for the same work. We're excluded from participating in church governance despite being the majority of church members.

The most controversial resolution demands women's suffrage - the right to vote. Even many convention supporters think this goes too far. It will make us look ridiculous, they argue. We should focus on property rights and education first. But Stanton insists: without political power, we can't secure any other rights. Douglass speaks powerfully in favor, arguing that excluding women from voting is as unjust as excluding Black men. The suffrage resolution passes, but narrowly.
