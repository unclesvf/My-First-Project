Chapter 4. Wilson's Fourteen Points and the Treaty of Versailles.

President Wilson arrived in Paris for the peace conference with an idealistic vision. His Fourteen Points, announced in January 1918, outlined principles for lasting peace:

• No secret treaties - open diplomacy
• Freedom of the seas
• Free trade among nations
• Reduced armaments
• Adjustment of colonial claims considering native peoples' interests
• Self-determination for European peoples - letting nations govern themselves
• League of Nations - an international organization to prevent future wars

European leaders were less idealistic. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, French Premier Georges Clemenceau, and Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando wanted to punish Germany and protect their own interests.

Clemenceau was particularly harsh. France had been invaded, suffered enormous casualties, and wanted revenge. "America is far away, protected by the ocean," Clemenceau said. "We are next to Germany. We want security."

The Treaty of Versailles, signed June 28, 1919, reflected this tension between Wilson's idealism and European vengeanc e.

The treaty forced Germany to:
• Accept full responsibility for causing the war (the "war guilt" clause)
• Pay massive reparations - $33 billion in damages
• Lose all colonies and 13% of European territory
• Limit its army to 100,000 men with no tanks, aircraft, or submarines
• Demilitarize the Rhineland

These terms were intentionally punishing. Germany wasn't even allowed to participate in negotiations - they were presented with the treaty and told to sign it.

The treaty created new nations - Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia - based on self-determination. But it also created resentments and instabilities that would lead to future conflicts.

Most importantly for Wilson, the treaty established the League of Nations - an international organization where nations could resolve disputes peacefully. Wilson believed the League would correct the treaty's flaws and prevent future wars.

But could he convince the American Senate to accept it?
