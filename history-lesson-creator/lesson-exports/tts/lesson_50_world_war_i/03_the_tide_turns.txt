Chapter 3. The Tide Turns.

By spring 1918, Germany launched a massive offensive, trying to win before American troops arrived in force. They broke through Allied lines, advancing toward Paris. For weeks, the outcome was uncertain. Would Germany win before America could tip the balance?

Then the flood of American troops turned the tide. Over two million American soldiers reached France by late 1918. We were fresh, enthusiastic, and numerous. We lacked the experience of British and French troops who'd fought for four years, but we had energy and numbers.

The Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918 stopped the German advance. American forces played a crucial role. Then came the Hundred Days Offensive - a series of Allied attacks from August to November that pushed German forces back.

I fought in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, the largest American battle of the war. Over one million American soldiers attacked German positions in eastern France. The fighting was brutal. In 47 days, we suffered 26,000 dead and 95,000 wounded. But we broke through German lines.

By November, Germany's army was collapsing. Food shortages at home caused riots. The German navy mutinied. The Kaiser abdicated. On November 11, 1918, at 11 a.m. - the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month - the armistice took effect. The guns finally fell silent.

I was in the trenches when the ceasefire began. At 10:59, artillery fired. At 11:00, silence. After four years of constant noise, the quiet was eerie. Men cried, cheered, prayed. We'd survived. The war was over.

But the cost was staggering. Over 9 million soldiers dead worldwide. 21 million wounded. Entire generation of young men decimated. 116,000 Americans dead, 204,000 wounded. Families across America mourned sons, brothers, husbands, fathers.

The "war to end all wars," Wilson called it. Standing in those trenches, seeing the devastation, I desperately wanted to believe him.
