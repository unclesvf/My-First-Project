Chapter 5. Coming Home to a Changed Nation.

The Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles and refused to join the League of Nations. Wilson toured the country promoting the treaty, but suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed. Without his leadership, the treaty died.

Many senators feared the League would entangle America in foreign conflicts. Article X required members to defend each other against aggression. Senators argued this surrendered American sovereignty to an international body. Americans had just fought a war in Europe. Now we wanted to return to our own affairs.

So America never joined the League of Nations - the organization Wilson created. Without American participation, the League lacked power to prevent future conflicts. Wilson's dream of collective security died.

I returned home to Nebraska in January 1919. My hometown welcomed us with parades and celebrations. But I felt disconnected. Civilians celebrated our victory. We remembered the horror.

I can't explain what I saw to people who weren't there. How do you describe watching friends die? Living in trenches? Going over the top knowing you might die in the next minute? The war changed us in ways civilians can't understand.

Many veterans struggled to readjust. Some couldn't hold jobs, plagued by what they'd seen. Others drank to forget. We didn't have words like "PTSD" then, but we knew the war had damaged us psychologically, not just physically.

America changed too. The war expanded federal power dramatically. The government drafted soldiers, controlled industries, restricted speech, encouraged conformity. Women worked in factories, earning money and independence. Black Americans migrated north seeking industrial jobs, beginning the Great Migration. The war accelerated social changes already underway.

Looking back, I see the war's failures. It didn't end all wars - it planted seeds for World War II. The harsh treaty terms created German resentment that Hitler would exploit. The League failed without American participation. Millions died for territorial gains that lasted barely twenty years.

But the war also showed American power on the world stage. We helped defeat Germany. We proposed principles for international peace. We demonstrated that oceans no longer isolated us from world affairs. America emerged from World War I as a major world power, though we didn't fully accept that role until World War II forced us to.

I'm twenty-one now, a veteran of the Great War. I survived when many didn't. I saw the worst humanity can do - industrial slaughter in muddy trenches. I also saw courage, sacrifice, and solidarity among soldiers who protected each other.

The war taught me that peace isn't natural or automatic. It requires work, wisdom, and willingness to address conflicts before they explode into violence. Wilson understood this. His Fourteen Points and League of Nations represented humanity's hope to prevent future wars through cooperation rather than force.

We failed his vision. The League collapsed. Another world war came. But the dream didn't die. After World War II, we'd try again with the United Nations. Maybe someday we'll learn to resolve conflicts without sending young men to die in trenches.

For now, I'm home, trying to build a normal life, carrying memories I'll never escape. The Great War is over. But for those of us who fought it, the war will never truly end.
