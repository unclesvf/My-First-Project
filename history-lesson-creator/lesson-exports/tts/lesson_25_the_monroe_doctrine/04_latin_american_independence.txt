Chapter 4. Latin American Independence.

I've learned about the revolutions sweeping Latin America. Leaders like Simón Bolívar in South America and Miguel Hidalgo in Mexico led wars for independence, inspired by America's example. They wrote constitutions modeled on ours, established republics, abolished many (though not all) aspects of colonial society.

These new nations looked to America for support. They hoped we'd recognize them as sister republics fighting for liberty against European tyranny. Some even imagined a hemisphere of republics standing together against European monarchy.

But America's support was limited. We recognized their independence and issued the Monroe Doctrine to protect them from reconquest. But we didn't offer military alliances or significant aid. Monroe warned Europe to stay out, but he also said we wouldn't interfere in existing European colonies or European affairs.

Father says this makes sense - we're too weak to fight European powers directly. The doctrine works because Britain's navy will quietly enforce it, protecting trade routes Britain needs. Without British naval power, the doctrine would be empty words. We're declaring principles we can't enforce alone, relying on Britain's self-interest to make them real.

Still, the doctrine expresses American ideals: republicanism over monarchy, independence over colonialism, the New World free from Old World control. It says America stands for liberty in the Western Hemisphere, even if we don't always live up to that promise at home.
