Chapter 5. Claiming the Hemisphere.

The Monroe Doctrine reveals American ambitions. We're not just protecting other nations' independence - we're claiming the Western Hemisphere as our sphere of influence. We're warning Europe that we'll be the dominant power here, that our interests matter most in the Americas.

This will shape American foreign policy for centuries. Future presidents will cite the Monroe Doctrine to justify interventions, occupations, and assertions of American power throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The doctrine protecting independence will sometimes become justification for American imperialism.

I see this tension in conversations at Father's office. Some State Department officials genuinely want to protect Latin American republics from European reconquest. Others see the doctrine as securing American dominance, keeping European competitors out so America can expand its influence.

What about Latin Americans themselves? Do they want American "protection"? Or do they see us as potential rivals, another power claiming authority over them? Father admits these questions trouble him. "We mean well," he says. "We're protecting republican government from monarchical restoration. But protecting can become controlling. Helping can become dominating. Future generations will have to ensure the doctrine serves liberty, not just American interests."
