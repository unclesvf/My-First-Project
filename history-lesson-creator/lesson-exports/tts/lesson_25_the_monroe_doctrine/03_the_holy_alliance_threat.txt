Chapter 3. The Holy Alliance Threat.

Father explains why the doctrine was necessary. After Napoleon's defeat, European monarchies formed the Holy Alliance - Russia, Prussia, Austria, and later France. They were committed to crushing republican and democratic movements, restoring monarchy and "legitimate" rule wherever revolutions occurred.

The Holy Alliance helped Spain suppress rebellions in Europe. Now they threatened to help Spain reconquer its American colonies. These newly independent republics - Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and others - had thrown off Spanish rule inspired by American and French revolutionary ideals. The Holy Alliance viewed them as dangerous examples of republican government that had to be crushed.

Britain opposed this too, but for different reasons. They wanted to trade with independent Latin American nations, not see them return to Spanish mercantile control. So Britain's foreign secretary suggested a joint British-American declaration against European intervention.

John Quincy Adams argued against a joint declaration. "It would be more candid, as well as more dignified," he said, "to avow our principles explicitly to Russia and France, than to come in as a cock-boat in the wake of the British man-of-war." Adams wanted an independent American policy, not one hidden behind Britain's skirts. Monroe agreed, and the doctrine became purely American.
