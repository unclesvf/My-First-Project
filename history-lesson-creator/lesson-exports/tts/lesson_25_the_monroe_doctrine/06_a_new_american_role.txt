Chapter 6. A New American Role.

The Monroe Doctrine marks America's transition from struggling republic to confident power. Just forty years after our founding, we're declaring ourselves protector of an entire hemisphere. We're telling European empires - Britain, France, Spain, Russia - to stay out of Western Hemisphere affairs.

This confidence comes from surviving and thriving. We've won independence, weathered political divisions, fought Britain to a draw in 1812, doubled our size through the Louisiana Purchase, and are expanding westward. We've proven republican government can work on a large scale. We're economically growing and demographically exploding.

The doctrine also reveals American exceptionalism - our belief that we're different from other nations, that America has a special role in history. We see ourselves as the beacon of liberty, the model republic, the protector of freedom in the New World. This can inspire us to do good, but it can also blind us to our own flaws and justify our own expansion at others' expense.

Standing in the State Department as Monroe's message is copied and dispatched to European capitals, I feel the weight of what's happening. We're declaring American power and purpose. We're claiming responsibility for hemisphere's future. We're asserting that the age of European dominance in the Americas is over.

Whether this doctrine will protect liberty or serve empire, whether it will inspire or oppress, whether it will unite the hemisphere or divide it - only time will tell. But one thing is clear: America is no longer a weak nation begging for respect. We're a power making demands, claiming authority, shaping our hemisphere's destiny. For better or worse, the Americas will never be the same.
