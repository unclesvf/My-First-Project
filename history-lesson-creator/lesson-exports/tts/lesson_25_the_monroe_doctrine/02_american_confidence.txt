Chapter 2. American Confidence.

The Monroe Doctrine shows how much America has changed since 1776. We've survived two wars with Britain. We've doubled our size. We're growing economically. We're confident enough to tell European powers to stay out of our hemisphere.

This doctrine will guide American foreign policy for decades. It says America is the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere. It reflects our belief in republicanism over monarchy. It shows our growing power and ambition.

But there are contradictions. We proclaim liberty for Latin America while enslaving people at home. We claim to protect sovereignty while pushing Native Americans off their land. We warn Europe against colonization while we expand westward. The gap between our ideals and our actions will haunt us.
