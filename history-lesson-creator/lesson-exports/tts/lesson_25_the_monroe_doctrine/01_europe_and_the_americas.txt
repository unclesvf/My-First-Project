Chapter 1. Europe and the Americas.

I'm Clara, fifteen, and my father works at the State Department in Washington. Today President Monroe announced a new foreign policy that will shape America's future: the Monroe Doctrine.

The situation is this: Spain's colonies in Latin America have been fighting for independence, inspired by our revolution. Spain wants to reconquer them with help from European powers. Russia is expanding down the Pacific coast from Alaska. European monarchies want to restore old empires.

President Monroe, advised by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, declared that the Americas are closed to future European colonization. We won't interfere in European affairs, but Europe must not interfere in the Americas. The Western Hemisphere is now America's sphere of influence.

This is bold! We're a small nation compared to European powers. We don't have the military might to enforce this doctrine. But we're declaring that America will protect the independence of Western Hemisphere nations. Britain's navy will quietly support us - they want Latin American markets open for trade.
