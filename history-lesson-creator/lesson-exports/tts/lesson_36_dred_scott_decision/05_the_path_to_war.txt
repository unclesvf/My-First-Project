Chapter 5. The Path to War.

Four years after the Dred Scott decision, the Civil War begins. I'm twenty now, watching the nation tear itself apart over the question the Supreme Court tried to settle.

Looking back, I see how the decision made war more likely. Before Dred Scott, there were potential compromises: ban slavery in some territories, allow it in others; admit states in pairs (one free, one slave); enforce the Fugitive Slave Act while limiting slavery's expansion.

After Dred Scott, these compromises seemed impossible. The Court had ruled that any restriction on slavery was unconstitutional. But Republicans, who won a majority in the North, refused to accept this. They campaigned explicitly on stopping slavery's expansion, directly contradicting the Supreme Court.

In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected president without winning a single Southern state. His election showed that the North would never accept the Dred Scott decision. Southern states, believing their constitutional rights would not be protected, began seceding.

The irony is bitter: Taney thought his decision would settle the slavery question and preserve the Union. Instead, it hastened the Union's dissolution. By denying any middle ground, by declaring slavery constitutionally protected everywhere, he made peaceful coexistence impossible.

Dred Scott himself was freed shortly after the decision - his owner emancipated him. He died a free man in 1858, just months after the Supreme Court said he had no rights. His widow and daughters lived to see the Thirteenth Amendment abolish slavery in 1865, overturning Taney's ruling.

I think about that phrase often: "No rights which the white man was bound to respect." It still stings. But the Civil War and the constitutional amendments that followed proved Taney wrong. We do have rights. We are citizens. We are human beings entitled to dignity, equality, and justice.

The Dred Scott decision was the Supreme Court's greatest failure - a stain on American law that took a war and constitutional amendments to erase. It taught a painful lesson: courts can't save a nation from itself. When fundamental moral questions divide a people, legal decisions won't resolve them. Only the people themselves, through struggle and sacrifice, can build a more just society.

Taney died in 1864, with the Union he tried to preserve broken by war and the slavery system he tried to protect crumbling. History has judged him harshly, and rightly so. The Dred Scott decision stands as a warning: law without justice is tyranny, and courts that protect oppression betray their purpose.
