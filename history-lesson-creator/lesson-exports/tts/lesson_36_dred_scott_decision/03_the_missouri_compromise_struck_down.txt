Chapter 3. The Missouri Compromise Struck Down.

Taney's opinion went further than just denying Dred Scott's freedom and Black citizenship. He struck down the Missouri Compromise, the law that had regulated slavery in the territories for 37 years.

The Missouri Compromise of 1820 banned slavery north of the 36°30' line in the Louisiana Territory. It was a carefully crafted compromise that had kept peace for decades. But Taney ruled it unconstitutional.

His reasoning: Congress has no power to ban slavery in the territories. Enslaved people are property, protected by the Fifth Amendment, which says property cannot be taken without due process. Banning slavery in territories would deprive slaveholders of their property rights.

Think about the implications. If Congress can't ban slavery in territories, then slavery can expand anywhere. The Republican Party's entire platform - stopping slavery's expansion - is unconstitutional according to the Supreme Court.

Popular sovereignty is also undermined. If slaveholders have a constitutional right to bring enslaved people into any territory, how can territorial legislatures vote to ban slavery? The Supreme Court has essentially said slavery must be allowed everywhere.

Free states like Pennsylvania are theoretically still free, but even that feels uncertain. If enslaved people are property, and property rights are protected by the Constitution, couldn't a slaveholder bring enslaved people into Pennsylvania and claim constitutional protection? The logic of Taney's decision could theoretically nationalize slavery.

Northerners are outraged. The Chicago Tribune writes: "The Constitution is now what the Supreme Court says it is, not what the People say it is." The New York Tribune calls it a "wicked and false judgment."

But it's the law of the land. And we have no recourse except to change the Court - which requires electing a president who will appoint different justices. But how long will that take?
