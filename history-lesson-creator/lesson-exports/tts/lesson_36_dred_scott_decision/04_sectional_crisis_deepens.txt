Chapter 4. Sectional Crisis Deepens.

The reaction to the Dred Scott decision splits along sectional lines, making the national divide even worse.

Southerners celebrate. Finally, they say, the Supreme Court has recognized their rights. Slavery is constitutional. It can't be banned in territories. The Republican Party's platform is unconstitutional. Southern newspapers call it a great victory for constitutional law.

Some Southern politicians take it further. Senator Albert Brown of Mississippi says if slavery is constitutionally protected in territories, it must be protected in states too. He proposes a federal slave code to enforce slavery everywhere. Other Southerners talk about reopening the African slave trade, banned since 1808.

Northerners are furious. Republicans call the decision illegitimate, a political ruling rather than a legal one. They point out that Taney could have ruled narrowly - just deciding that Scott, as a non-citizen, couldn't sue in federal court. Instead, he issued a sweeping opinion about slavery in the territories, going beyond what the case required.

Abraham Lincoln, a Republican lawyer from Illinois, says the decision is wrongly decided and not binding as a permanent precedent. He argues that if Republicans win the presidency, they can effectively ignore the decision by appointing new justices who will overturn it.

This is extraordinary: a major political party vowing to defy a Supreme Court decision. It shows how completely the constitutional system is breaking down. The Court was supposed to be the final arbiter, the institution that settles disputes peacefully. Now its rulings are rejected by half the country.

The free Black community is devastated but not surprised. We've always known that American law didn't protect us equally. But having it stated so explicitly by the Supreme Court is a blow. Some free Black families consider emigrating to Canada or Liberia, despairing of ever achieving equality in America.

The Dred Scott decision doesn't resolve the slavery crisis. It deepens it. It radicalizes both sides and eliminates the middle ground.
