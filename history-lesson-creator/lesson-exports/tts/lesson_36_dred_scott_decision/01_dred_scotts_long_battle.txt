Chapter 1. Dred Scott's Long Battle.

I'm Frederick, sixteen years old, and I'm free. My father was born enslaved but bought his freedom and moved our family to Pennsylvania, a free state. We have our own home, our own business. We're free - or so I thought.

Today, March 6, 1857, the Supreme Court announced its decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford. We've been following this case for years, hoping for justice. Dred Scott was enslaved in Missouri. His owner, an army surgeon, took him to Illinois (a free state) and then to Wisconsin Territory (free under the Missouri Compromise). Scott lived in free territory for years, married there, had children there.

When they returned to Missouri, Scott's owner died. Scott sued for his freedom, arguing that living in free territory had made him free. It seemed like a clear case: if you live as a free man in free territory, you should be free.

The case went through Missouri courts, then federal courts, finally reaching the Supreme Court. The free Black community watched anxiously. If Scott won, it would establish that enslaved people who entered free territory became free. It would be a major victory for freedom.

We should have known better than to hope. The Supreme Court has nine justices. Five are from slave states. Chief Justice Roger Taney is from Maryland, a state that depends on slavery. President Buchanan, who just took office, pressured justices to settle the slavery question once and for all.

Today we learned the result. And it's worse than we imagined.
