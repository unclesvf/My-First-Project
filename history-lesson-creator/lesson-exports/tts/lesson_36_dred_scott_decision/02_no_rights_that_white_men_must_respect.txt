Chapter 2. No Rights That White Men Must Respect.

Chief Justice Taney's opinion was read in the courtroom. The words spread through the free Black community like fire. I heard them from my father, who heard them from a lawyer friend.

Taney ruled that Black people - whether enslaved or free - are not citizens of the United States. We cannot sue in federal court. We have no standing before the law.

Then came the most devastating sentence: Black people "had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect."

No rights which the white man was bound to respect.

I am sixteen years old. I was born free in Pennsylvania. My father worked for years to earn his freedom and build a life for us. We pay taxes. We obey laws. We contribute to our community. And the highest court in the land says we have no rights that white men must respect.

The ruling doesn't just deny Dred Scott his freedom - it denies my humanity. It says that my family, despite living in a free state, could be kidnapped and enslaved, and we'd have no legal recourse. We're not citizens. We're not even fully human in the eyes of the law.

Mother cried when she heard. Father was silent, his jaw clenched. My younger sister asked, "Does this mean we're not free anymore?" I didn't know how to answer.

The Dred Scott decision tells us that America - with all its talk of liberty and equality - doesn't include us. We're outsiders in the country where we were born.
