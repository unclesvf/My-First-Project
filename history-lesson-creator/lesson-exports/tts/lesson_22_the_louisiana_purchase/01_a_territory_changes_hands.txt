Chapter 1. A Territory Changes Hands.

I'm Marie, fourteen, living in New Orleans. My city has been French, then Spanish, now French again, and today I learned we're about to become American! The news arrived: President Jefferson has purchased all of Louisiana from Napoleon for $15 million.

The Louisiana Territory is enormous - over 800,000 square miles stretching from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains. It doubles the size of the United States! Napoleon needed money for his wars in Europe and feared losing Louisiana to Britain, so he sold it to America.

President Jefferson faced a dilemma. The Constitution doesn't explicitly say the president can buy territory. Jefferson believes in strict interpretation - the federal government should only have powers specifically listed in the Constitution. But this deal is too good to pass up. He approved it anyway, setting aside his principles for practical benefit.
