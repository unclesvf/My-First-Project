Chapter 2. New Opportunities.

The Purchase solves major problems for America. We needed access to New Orleans - the mouth of the Mississippi River where western farmers ship their goods. France controlling it was dangerous. Now America controls the entire Mississippi River system.

The territory offers endless land for settlement. Thomas Jefferson imagines an "empire of liberty" - a vast nation of independent farmers spreading across the continent. This land makes that vision possible.

But questions loom. What about the Native peoples living there? What about slavery - will it spread into these new territories? How do you govern such a vast area? These questions will haunt America for decades, eventually leading to civil war. For now, though, Americans celebrate. We've doubled our nation's size for just three cents an acre.
