Chapter 3. Jefferson's Dilemma.

My father explains President Jefferson's predicament. Jefferson has always preached strict construction - the federal government should only exercise powers explicitly granted in the Constitution. He's criticized Hamilton and the Federalists for loose interpretation, claiming they stretch the Constitution to justify whatever they want.

But the Constitution says nothing about purchasing foreign territory. Nowhere does it grant the president or Congress the power to buy land from other nations. By Jefferson's own principles, the Louisiana Purchase might be unconstitutional.

Jefferson agonized over this. He drafted a constitutional amendment to explicitly allow the purchase. But his advisors warned that seeking an amendment would take time, and Napoleon might change his mind or demand a higher price. The opportunity might slip away.

In the end, Jefferson swallowed his principles and authorized the purchase. He argued weakly that the treaty-making power implied the right to acquire territory. Federalists laughed at his hypocrisy - Jefferson was doing exactly what he'd accused them of doing, stretching the Constitution to justify what he wanted.

"Sometimes principles must bend to reality," Father says, though he's a Jefferson supporter. "Would it have been better to follow strict construction and lose half a continent? Jefferson made the right choice, even if it contradicted his philosophy." I wonder if Father is right, or if Jefferson proved that principles matter less than power.
