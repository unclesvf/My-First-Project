Chapter 4. Life in New Orleans.

My city, New Orleans, is unlike anywhere else in America. We're French and Spanish, Catholic and Creole. We speak French more than English. We have free people of color who own businesses and property - something unheard of in most of America. Our food, music, and culture come from a blend of French, Spanish, African, and Caribbean influences.

Now we're becoming American, and no one knows what that means for us. Will they respect our language and religion? Will they honor our land grants and legal traditions? Will they accept our free Black population, or try to force everyone into their rigid system of slavery versus freedom?

American officials arrive talking about "civilizing" us, teaching us "American ways." They look down on our culture as backward and foreign. They're shocked by our festivals, our mixed-race communities, our Catholic schools. Some Americans talk about New Orleans like we're exotic territory to be conquered, not fellow citizens to be respected.

But Father is hopeful. "America is an idea, not an ethnicity," he says. "They'll have to learn that America can include French-speaking Catholics from New Orleans. We'll make them expand their understanding of what American means." I hope he's right. The Louisiana Purchase didn't just add land to America - it added us, people whose culture and traditions challenge America's assumptions about itself.
