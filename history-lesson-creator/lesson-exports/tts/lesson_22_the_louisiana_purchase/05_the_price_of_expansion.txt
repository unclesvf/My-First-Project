Chapter 5. The Price of Expansion.

While Americans celebrate acquiring vast new territory, few ask about the people already living there. Tens of thousands of Native peoples call Louisiana home: Osage, Caddo, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and dozens of other nations. France just sold their land without their consent. America just bought it without acknowledging Native ownership.

My father trades with Native peoples along the Mississippi. "They're furious," he tells me. "France had no right to sell their land. America has no right to claim it. They've been here for thousands of years - how can someone sell what they don't own?"

But Americans see it differently. They believe European nations have sovereignty over North America through "discovery" and conquest. Native peoples might live on the land, but they don't "own" it in the legal sense European powers recognize. It's a convenient fiction that allows Americans to claim an enormous territory as vacant land ready for settlement.

Jefferson talks about his "empire of liberty," but whose liberty? Not the Native nations whose lands we've purchased. Not the enslaved people who'll be brought into these territories as slavery expands westward. The Louisiana Purchase doubles America's size, but it also doubles our fundamental contradictions.

Standing in New Orleans as the American flag replaces the French tricolor, I wonder what we've really bought. Land, yes - 800,000 square miles of it. But we've also bought new questions that will tear at the nation's soul: How far west will slavery spread? What happens to Native peoples in the path of American expansion? Can a nation founded on liberty spread by taking land from its original inhabitants?

For now, Americans celebrate. The Louisiana Purchase seems like pure triumph - doubled land, access to the Mississippi, room for generations to grow. But I sense the questions we're avoiding will someday demand answers. You can purchase land, but you can't purchase the solution to moral dilemmas.
