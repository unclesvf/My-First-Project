Chapter 3. The Disputed Election of 1876.

November 1876. The presidential election pits Republican Rutherford B. Hayes against Democrat Samuel Tilden. It's a crucial election - the Democratic platform explicitly calls for ending Reconstruction and removing federal troops from the South.

Election night, Tilden appears to have won. He carries most Southern states and several Northern states. He has 184 electoral votes to Hayes's 165. He needs just one more electoral vote to win the presidency.

But twenty electoral votes are disputed - nineteen from the three Southern states still under Republican control (Louisiana, South Carolina, Florida) and one from Oregon. In the South, both parties claim victory, submitting competing election returns. Democrats say they won legitimately. Republicans say Democrats won through violence and fraud - which is largely true.

If all twenty disputed votes go to Hayes, he wins 185-184. If even one goes to Tilden, Tilden becomes president. The Constitution provides no clear mechanism for resolving disputed electoral votes. The nation faces a constitutional crisis.

Congress creates an Electoral Commission - fifteen members split between Republicans, Democrats, and Supreme Court justices. The commission votes along party lines, 8-7, awarding all disputed votes to Hayes. Democrats are furious, calling it a stolen election.

Some Democrats talk of resuming the Civil War. There's talk of armed resistance, of not allowing Hayes to take office. The nation teeters on the edge of renewed conflict.

Then, in back-room negotiations, a deal is struck: the Compromise of 1877.

Republicans agree to withdraw federal troops from the South, ending Reconstruction and military protection of Black rights. They promise federal funding for Southern internal improvements and a Southerner in Hayes's cabinet.

Democrats agree to accept Hayes as president and to respect Black civil and political rights - a promise they'll immediately break.
