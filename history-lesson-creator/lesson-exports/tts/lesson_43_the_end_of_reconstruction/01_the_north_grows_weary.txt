Chapter 1. The North Grows Weary.

I'm Samuel, seventeen years old, and I live in Mississippi. I was born free in 1860, just before the Civil War. My early childhood was during slavery, though my family was free. I grew up during Reconstruction, experiencing both its promise and its betrayal.

By the mid-1870s, Northern commitment to Reconstruction is fading. Several factors explain why.

First, economic crisis. The Panic of 1873 triggered a severe depression - the worst in American history to that point. Banks failed. Businesses collapsed. Unemployment soared. Northern voters care more about economic recovery than Southern Black rights. Democrats campaign on ending expensive Reconstruction programs and letting the South govern itself.

Second, scandal. The Grant administration is plagued by corruption scandals - the Crédit Mobilier railroad scandal, the Whiskey Ring tax fraud, and others. Republicans, the party of Reconstruction, lose credibility. Democrats gain ground, winning control of the House of Representatives in 1874.

Third, fatigue. The Civil War ended in 1865. Reconstruction has lasted over a decade. Northern voters are tired of military occupation, political battles, and "the Negro question." They want to move on. Many believe Reconstruction has done enough - slavery ended, constitutional amendments passed. What more do Black people want?

The answer, of course, is actual equality and protection. Constitutional amendments mean nothing if states won't enforce them and the federal government won't intervene. But white Northerners, who never fully supported racial equality anyway, are losing interest in fighting for it.

I see this shift in Mississippi. Federal troops used to protect Black voters. Now there are fewer troops, and they rarely intervene when white supremacists intimidate voters. The Freedmen's Bureau closed in 1872. Federal enforcement of civil rights laws weakens. We're increasingly on our own, facing determined white opposition without federal protection.
