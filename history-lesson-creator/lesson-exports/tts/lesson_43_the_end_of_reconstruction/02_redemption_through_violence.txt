Chapter 2. Redemption Through Violence.

White Southern Democrats launch campaigns to "redeem" the South - their term for restoring white supremacy and Democratic control. They use legal and illegal methods, but mostly violence and intimidation.

In Mississippi, the 1875 election campaign is called the "Mississippi Plan" - a blueprint for violently overthrowing Republican governments. White militias, sometimes called "White Leagues" or "Red Shirts," intimidate and murder Black voters and white Republicans.

I witness it personally. In September 1875, I attend a Republican rally in Clinton, Mississippi. White Democrats attack the gathering with guns. They murder dozens of Black people. The violence spreads across the state. Over 300 Black people are killed in the months leading to the election.

Father, a Republican organizer, goes into hiding. White militias search for him, promising to "string him up" if they find him. We hide him in the woods. He can't campaign, can't even vote safely.

On election day, armed white men surround polling places. They fire guns into the air, threatening any Black person who tries to vote. In some areas, they prevent Black voters from reaching polls at all. In others, they force Black voters to vote Democratic at gunpoint.

The result is predictable: Democrats sweep the election through fraud and terror. Mississippi is "redeemed" - white supremacists control the government again.

We appeal to President Grant for federal intervention. Grant sends a half-hearted response. He's politically weakened by scandals and facing Northern opposition to continued intervention in the South. Mississippi's Republican governor, Adelbert Ames, is forced to resign. Democrats take complete control.

By 1876, only three Southern states - Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida - still have Republican governments protected by federal troops. The rest have been "redeemed" through violence. Reconstruction is collapsing.
