Chapter 4. The Last Troops Leave.

April 1877. President Hayes orders the last federal troops withdrawn from Louisiana and South Carolina. Reconstruction is over.

I watch as Union soldiers leave Jackson, Mississippi. They've been our protectors - the only force preventing complete white supremacist control. Now they're leaving, and we're left defenseless.

The symbolism is stark. Soldiers who fought to free us, who protected our rights during Reconstruction, are abandoning us to the very people who enslaved us. It feels like a betrayal of everything the Civil War was fought for.

Within days of the troops' departure, Democratic "Redeemers" take complete control of Southern state governments. They immediately begin dismantling Reconstruction's achievements.

They cut funding for public schools, especially Black schools. They pass laws restricting Black voting rights - poll taxes, literacy tests, understanding clauses, grandfather clauses. These laws are designed to circumvent the Fifteenth Amendment while appearing race-neutral.

They establish segregation laws, soon called "Jim Crow" laws after a racist minstrel show character. These laws mandate separate facilities for Black and white people - schools, railroad cars, restaurants, hotels, water fountains, even cemeteries. The Supreme Court will uphold these laws in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), ruling that "separate but equal" doesn't violate the Fourteenth Amendment - even though separate is never equal.

They use violence and legal mechanisms to force Black people out of political office. Black legislators, sheriffs, and judges are threatened, attacked, or driven away. Within a few years, Black political participation drops dramatically.

Father tries to vote in the 1878 election. He's turned away at the polling place. The registrar says he failed the "understanding" test - he couldn't adequately explain a section of the state constitution. The test is subjective and impossible to pass if the registrar doesn't want you to vote. White people aren't required to take it.

Father, who risked his life to vote during Reconstruction, is disenfranchised in his own country.
