Chapter 2. The Haymarket Tragedy.

May 3, 1886. At the McCormick Reaper Works, police attack striking workers, killing two. Labor activists call for a protest rally the next evening at Haymarket Square.

May 4. About 3,000 people gather at Haymarket Square. Speakers denounce police violence and demand workers' rights. Chicago's mayor attends and later says the rally was peaceful. He leaves around 10 p.m. when the crowd thins.

Around 10:30, police suddenly march on the remaining crowd - about 300 people - and order them to disperse. The rally is peaceful and legal, but police want it ended.

Then it happens. Someone throws a bomb into the police ranks. The explosion kills one officer instantly and wounds many others. Police open fire into the crowd. Workers fire back - some are armed. The shooting lasts minutes but feels like hours.

When the smoke clears, seven police officers are dead or dying (most from friendly fire, investigators later conclude). At least four civilians are dead, dozens wounded. No one knows who threw the bomb. The bomber was never identified.

But Chicago's authorities blame anarchists - radical activists who advocate abolishing government. They arrest eight labor leaders, though there's no evidence linking them to the bombing. The trial is a sham - the prosecution produces no evidence of who threw the bomb, only inflammatory speeches by the defendants advocating workers' rights.

All eight are convicted. Seven are sentenced to death. One commits suicide in jail. Four are hanged. Three have their sentences commuted to life in prison. Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld later pardons the survivors, calling the trial unjust.

The Haymarket Affair devastates the labor movement. Employers paint all unions as dangerous anarchists. The Knights of Labor collapses. The eight-hour day movement stalls. Workers are afraid to organize, fearing they'll be called anarchists and arrested.
