Chapter 3. The AFL and Craft Unionism.

After Haymarket, labor organizers change tactics. Samuel Gompers, a cigar maker, builds the American Federation of Labor (AFL) founded in 1886. The AFL takes a different approach from the Knights of Labor.

The AFL organizes only skilled workers - craftsmen like carpenters, machinists, printers. It excludes unskilled workers, women, and minorities. Gompers says skilled workers have bargaining power because they're harder to replace. Unskilled workers can be replaced easily, making them harder to organize.

The AFL focuses on "bread and butter" issues: wages, hours, and working conditions. It avoids radical politics. It doesn't call for overthrowing capitalism or fundamental economic change. It just wants better pay and shorter hours for its members.

The AFL uses collective bargaining - negotiating with employers as a group rather than individually. If employers refuse to negotiate, the AFL calls strikes. But AFL strikes are disciplined and organized, not spontaneous or violent.

This moderate approach succeeds better than radical tactics. By 1900, the AFL has one million members. It wins wage increases and hour reductions for skilled workers. Some AFL unions achieve the eight-hour day.

But the AFL's success is limited. It organizes only about 10% of the workforce - the skilled elite. The vast majority of workers - unskilled laborers, women, immigrants, Black workers - remain unorganized and exploited.

I'm not a skilled craftsman, so the AFL won't accept me. I'm still working fourteen-hour days for low wages with no union protection. The AFL's success for some workers doesn't help workers like me.

The fundamental problem remains: workers have no power individually. Employers can fire us, cut wages, worsen conditions. Only collective organization gives workers power. But organizing is dangerous - employers fire union members, blacklist them, use violence against strikes.
