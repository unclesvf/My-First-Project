Chapter 1. The Eight-Hour Day Movement.

I'm Michael, seventeen years old, and I work in a factory in Chicago making agricultural equipment. I work fourteen hours a day, six days a week. I start at 6 a.m. and finish at 8 p.m. By the time I get home, eat dinner, and sleep, there's no time for anything else. No education. No family life. No rest. Just work, sleep, work, sleep.

This is normal for American workers in the 1880s. Factory workers, miners, railroad workers - we all work twelve to fourteen hours daily. Many work seven days a week. Children as young as ten work the same hours.

But workers are organizing to change this. The eight-hour day movement demands a basic reform: limit the workday to eight hours. "Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will" is our slogan.

It seems reasonable, even modest. But employers resist fiercely. They say shorter hours would reduce production and profits. They say workers would waste free time drinking. They say competition requires long hours.

Labor unions are growing. The Knights of Labor, founded in 1869, organizes workers across industries. By 1886, it has 700,000 members. The movement is building momentum for the eight-hour day.

May 1, 1886 - May Day - hundreds of thousands of workers across America strike for the eight-hour day. In Chicago, 80,000 workers walk off jobs. Factories shut down. The city grinds to a halt.

I join the strike. We march through Chicago's streets, carrying signs demanding the eight-hour day. Employers call us radicals and socialists. Police watch us carefully, hands on clubs.

The strike is mostly peaceful. But tensions are rising. Some employers hire strikebreakers. Fights break out. Police attack picket lines. The atmosphere is tense, potentially violent.
