Chapter 4. The Triangle Shirtwaist Fire.

March 25, 1911. A fire breaks out at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City. The factory occupies the top three floors of a ten-story building. About 500 workers - mostly young immigrant women - work there making women's blouses.

The fire starts in a scrap bin and spreads rapidly through the fabric-filled workspace. Workers rush to escape. But the factory owners have locked the exit doors - they claim it prevents theft and unauthorized breaks.

Women pound on locked doors, screaming. Some break windows and jump from the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors. Firefighters' ladders only reach the sixth floor. Safety nets break under the weight of falling bodies.

The fire lasts less than 30 minutes. When it's over, 146 workers are dead - 123 women and 23 men. Some burned to death. Others died from smoke inhalation. Many jumped to their deaths rather than burn.

I read about it in the newspapers. The stories are horrifying. Girls as young as fourteen burned alive because doors were locked. Bodies piled in stairwells. Women jumping from windows, clothes on fire.

The public is outraged. Newspapers publish photos of bodies on the sidewalk, of coffins lined up for identification. People realize that factory workers face deadly conditions daily - locked doors, no fire escapes, flammable materials everywhere, no safety regulations.

The factory owners are tried for manslaughter but acquitted - they claim they didn't know the doors were locked. But a civil suit later finds them liable, and they pay $75 per victim to families - a pittance for a life.

The Triangle Fire becomes a turning point. Public outrage forces politicians to act. New York passes fire safety laws, factory inspection laws, limits on working hours for women and children. Other states follow. The tragedy proves that workers need government protection, not just union organization.

But change comes slowly, purchased with workers' lives.
