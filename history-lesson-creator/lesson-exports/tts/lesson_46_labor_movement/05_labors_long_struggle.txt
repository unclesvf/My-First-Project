Chapter 5. Labor's Long Struggle.

By 1914, I'm forty-five years old. I've been a factory worker my entire adult life. The labor movement has made progress, but it's been slow and costly.

Some workers have won the eight-hour day - mostly skilled workers in AFL unions. Some states have passed safety laws, child labor restrictions, workers' compensation. The Triangle Fire led to real reforms in New York.

But most workers still labor long hours in dangerous conditions for low pay. Employers still fire union organizers. Courts still issue injunctions breaking strikes. Police still attack picket lines. Corporate power still dominates politics.

I think about the Haymarket martyrs - hanged for advocating workers' rights. I think about the Triangle Fire victims - burned alive because owners locked doors. I think about the thousands of workers killed in mines, factories, railroads, construction every year.

Labor's victories come through struggle and sacrifice. Every reform - shorter hours, safety regulations, minimum wages, child labor laws - is opposed fiercely by employers and won only through strikes, protests, and political organizing.

The fundamental conflict remains: labor versus capital. Workers create wealth through our labor. But owners control that wealth and decide how it's distributed. Owners profit enormously. Workers barely survive.

Some radicals - socialists, anarchists, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) - argue the system is fundamentally unjust. They call for workers to own the means of production, to abolish wage labor itself. They organize unskilled workers, immigrants, women - everyone the AFL excludes.

Others - reformers, Progressives, moderate unions - argue the system can be fixed with regulations, unions, and gradual reforms. They don't want revolution, just fair treatment within capitalism.

I'm not sure who's right. But I know workers deserve better than we're getting. We deserve fair wages, safe conditions, reasonable hours, respect, and dignity. Whether we achieve that through moderate reforms or radical change, the struggle continues.

Looking at my son - he's fourteen and starting factory work like I did - I hope his generation will have better. I hope the labor movement will win real power. I hope workers will finally get what we've fought for: a fair share of the wealth we create, control over our own lives, and the respect we've earned through our labor.

That's what the labor movement is about - not just wages and hours, but human dignity and economic justice. The fight is far from over.
