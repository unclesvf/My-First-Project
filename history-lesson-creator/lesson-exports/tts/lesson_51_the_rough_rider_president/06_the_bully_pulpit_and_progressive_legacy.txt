Chapter 6. The Bully Pulpit and Progressive Legacy.

I loved being President. The presidency gave me what I called a "bully pulpit" - a platform to speak directly to the American people and advocate for the causes I believed in. And I used it constantly.

I broke presidential precedents right and left. I was the first president to invite an African American - Booker T. Washington - to dine at the White House, causing a scandal in the segregated South. I championed pure food and drug laws after reading Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle," which exposed horrific conditions in meatpacking plants. I supported workers' rights, regulated railroads, and protected consumers.

I believed in what I called "the stewardship theory" of the presidency. The president is a steward of the people, and should do anything necessary for their welfare unless explicitly forbidden by the Constitution. This was revolutionary - previous presidents took a narrow view of their powers.

I also believed in merit, not connections. I appointed people based on competence, not political favors. I started civil service reform, making government more professional and less corrupt.

When I left office in 1909, voluntarily stepping aside after nearly two full terms, I was only 50 years old - younger than most presidents when they're elected. I had transformed the presidency from a relatively weak office into the center of American government.

My Progressive policies - regulating big business, protecting consumers and workers, conserving natural resources, and using federal power to promote fairness - became the template for 20th century American government. My cousin Franklin would build on this foundation during the New Deal.

I showed that government could be a force for good, protecting ordinary people from powerful interests without destroying capitalism. That was my Square Deal: fairness, opportunity, and justice for all Americans, with special privileges for none. It is the legacy I am most proud of, and the principle that should guide every president who follows.
