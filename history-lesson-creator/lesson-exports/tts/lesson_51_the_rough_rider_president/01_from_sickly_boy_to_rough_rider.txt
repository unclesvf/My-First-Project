Chapter 1. From Sickly Boy to Rough Rider.

My name is Theodore Roosevelt, and I was not supposed to survive childhood. Born in 1858 to a wealthy New York family, I suffered from terrible asthma that left me gasping for breath, weak and confined indoors while other boys played. The doctors said I had a weak constitution and would never be strong.

But my father took me aside one day and said, "Theodore, you have the mind but not the body, and without the body the mind cannot go as far as it should. You must make your body." Those words changed my life.

I threw myself into physical fitness with the same intensity I brought to everything. Boxing, weightlifting, horseback riding, hiking - I pushed my body to its limits and beyond. I transformed myself from a sickly child into a robust, energetic young man. This taught me a lesson I never forgot: with determination and hard work, a person can overcome any obstacle.

I attended Harvard, married my sweetheart Alice, and entered politics as a New York State Assemblyman. I was young, brash, and eager to fight corruption. But tragedy struck when both my mother and my wife died on the same day in 1884. Devastated, I fled to the Dakota Territory to ranch and rebuild my spirit.

The West changed me. I lived as a cowboy, hunted buffalo, captured outlaws, and learned to appreciate the vast American wilderness. When I returned to New York, I was stronger in body and spirit, ready to continue my work in public service.

In 1898, when war with Spain erupted, I resigned my position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy to form a volunteer cavalry regiment - the Rough Riders. We charged up San Juan Hill in Cuba, and I returned home a war hero. This catapulted me to the governorship of New York, then to the vice presidency under William McKinley.
