Chapter 5. Speaking Softly and Carrying a Big Stick.

"Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far." This West African proverb became my motto for foreign policy. I believed America should be strong, confident, and willing to use power - but preferably to avoid war rather than wage it.

When I became president, America was emerging as a world power after our victory in the Spanish-American War. We had possessions in the Caribbean and Pacific. The question was: what kind of world power would we be?

I believed in a strong navy - "the big stick" that made others take us seriously. I expanded the Navy, building modern battleships and eventually sending the Great White Fleet around the world to demonstrate American power. When critics said it was too expensive, I replied that a strong navy prevented wars we couldn't afford to fight.

The Panama Canal was my greatest foreign policy achievement. For centuries, ships had to sail around South America to move between the Atlantic and Pacific. A canal through Central America would revolutionize trade and military mobility.

When Colombia rejected our treaty to build a canal through its province of Panama, I supported Panamanian independence. Some called this imperialism. I called it getting things done. The canal opened in 1914, one of the greatest engineering achievements in history, and it remains vital to world commerce today.

In 1905, I mediated the peace treaty ending the Russo-Japanese War, becoming the first American to win the Nobel Peace Prize. I proved America could be a global peacemaker, not just a military power.

I also issued the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, declaring that the United States would intervene in Latin American countries to prevent European intervention. Critics called this the "Big Stick" policy - imposing American will on smaller nations. I believed it was necessary to maintain stability and prevent European colonialism from returning to our hemisphere.
