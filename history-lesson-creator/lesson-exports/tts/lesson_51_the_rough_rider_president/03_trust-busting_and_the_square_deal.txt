Chapter 3. Trust-Busting and the Square Deal.

America in 1901 was dominated by massive corporations - trusts - that controlled entire industries. J.P. Morgan's banking empire, John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, Carnegie's steel monopoly - these men had more power than most governments. They fixed prices, crushed competitors, exploited workers, and corrupted politics.

Previous presidents had done little to challenge them. But I believed these trusts threatened democracy itself. When wealth becomes too concentrated, political power follows, and ordinary citizens lose their voice.

My first major act was to break up the Northern Securities Company, a railroad trust that J.P. Morgan himself had created. When Morgan came to the White House and said, "If we have done anything wrong, send your man to my man and they can fix it up," I replied, "That can't be done." Morgan was shocked that a President would treat him like an ordinary citizen subject to the law.

We won the case in the Supreme Court, and I earned the nickname "Trust-Buster." Over my presidency, we brought 44 antitrust suits, breaking up monopolies and restoring competition. I wasn't against big business - I recognized that large corporations were often more efficient. But I insisted they play fair and serve the public interest.

The Coal Strike of 1902 tested my principles. Coal miners, working in terrible conditions for poverty wages, went on strike. Mine owners refused to negotiate. As winter approached, Americans faced freezing without coal for heat. Previous presidents would have sent troops to break the strike.

Instead, I threatened to seize the mines and run them with Army troops unless owners negotiated. Shocked that a president would side with workers over capital, the owners agreed to arbitration. The miners got better wages and shorter hours. For the first time, a president had used federal power to help workers rather than crush them.
