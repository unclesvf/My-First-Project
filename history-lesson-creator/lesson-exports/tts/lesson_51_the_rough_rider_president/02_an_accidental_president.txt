Chapter 2. An Accidental President.

On September 14, 1901, I became President of the United States at age 42 - the youngest president in American history. But I did not want it to happen this way.

President McKinley had been shot by an assassin eight days earlier at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo. When I received the telegram that he was dying, I rushed to Buffalo, but arrived too late. McKinley was dead, and I was now President.

Republican Party bosses had made me vice president to sideline me - they thought I was too radical, too energetic, too unpredictable. Senator Mark Hanna famously said, "Now that damn cowboy is President!" They were right to worry. I had no intention of being a caretaker president.

I immediately made it clear I would continue McKinley's cabinet, providing stability during the transition. But I also signaled that things would change. "I wish to be a good President," I told reporters, "and to do this I must have the support of the people."

The presidency gave me a "bully pulpit" - a wonderful platform from which to advocate for the causes I believed in. And I believed in using the federal government to help ordinary Americans against the powerful special interests that dominated the Gilded Age.

My philosophy was simple: a Square Deal for every American. The government should act as an honest broker between labor and capital, between big business and the common man. No group should be able to dominate and exploit the others. This was a radical idea in 1901, when many believed government should leave business completely alone.
