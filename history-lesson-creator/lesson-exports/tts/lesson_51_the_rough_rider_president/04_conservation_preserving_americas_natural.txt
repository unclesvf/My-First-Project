Chapter 4. Conservation: Preserving America's Natural Heritage.

Of all my achievements, I am most proud of my conservation work. I was America's first conservation president, and I used every power at my disposal to protect our natural heritage.

Growing up, I loved nature - studying birds, collecting specimens, exploring forests. Out West as a young man, I saw the destruction firsthand: forests stripped bare, wildlife hunted to near extinction, beautiful landscapes ruined by unchecked exploitation. I realized that unless we acted, future generations would inherit a wasteland.

I believed in conservation, not preservation. Conservation means using natural resources wisely and sustainably, ensuring they last for future generations. We shouldn't lock away all wilderness, but neither should we destroy it for short-term profit.

I established 5 National Parks, 18 National Monuments, 51 Federal Bird Reserves, and 150 National Forests - protecting approximately 230 million acres. I created the U.S. Forest Service under Gifford Pinchot to manage these lands scientifically. I used every legal tool available, sometimes stretching my authority to its limits.

When Congress tried to stop me from creating more National Forests in the West, I worked around the clock with Pinchot to designate 21 new forests in a single week, then signed the bill limiting my authority. Congress was furious, but the forests were protected.

Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Devils Tower, Muir Woods - these treasures exist today because we fought to save them. I took John Muir camping in Yosemite, sleeping under the giant sequoias, and he convinced me these ancient groves must be preserved forever.

I also championed scientific management of wildlife. We saved the bison from extinction, protected migratory birds, and established the first wildlife refuges. Conservation wasn't just about scenery - it was about ensuring America's resources would sustain our children and grandchildren.
