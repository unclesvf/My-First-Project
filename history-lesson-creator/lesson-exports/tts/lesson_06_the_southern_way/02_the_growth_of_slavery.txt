Chapter 2. The Growth of Slavery.

Our neighbor, Mr. Randolph, is a wealthy planter. He owns a plantation with two hundred acres and twenty enslaved workers. I've seen them working in his fields from dawn to dusk, supervised by an overseer with a whip. The enslaved people live in small wooden cabins and grow their own food in small gardens.

Last month, a ship arrived from Africa with eighty enslaved people. Mr. Randolph bought three of them - two men and a woman. They looked terrified and exhausted. They didn't speak English and were separated from their families. Watching them, I felt sick to my stomach. Father saw my face and said quietly, "This is wrong, Thomas. But it's becoming the foundation of our colony's economy."

The laws are changing to make slavery permanent and hereditary. A new law says that children born to enslaved mothers will also be enslaved for life, no matter who the father is. Another law forbids enslaved people from carrying weapons, gathering in groups, or learning to read. These laws treat human beings as property, not people.

I asked Father why we don't speak out against slavery. He said quietly that those who do are shunned, lose business, and are called troublemakers. "The people who profit from slavery have all the power, Thomas. They make the laws in the House of Burgesses. They've convinced themselves it's acceptable because enslaved people are different from us. But that's a lie we tell ourselves to justify evil."
