Chapter 4. Understanding the System.

I've been thinking a lot about what Father said. How did we get here? How did English colonists who came seeking freedom create a system that denies freedom to others?

Father explained that it started gradually. First, colonists used indentured servants. But servants eventually went free and wanted their own land. Then some planters tried enslaving Native Americans, but they could escape into familiar territory. African people, forcibly brought across the ocean, couldn't escape home.

Slavery became more profitable as tobacco cultivation grew. Planters convinced themselves that enslaved Africans were inferior, that slavery was somehow natural or even beneficial. They created laws making slavery hereditary and permanent. They built an entire economy on this cruel foundation.

But Father reminds me that slavery is a choice, not inevitable. The Northern colonies are moving away from slavery. Pennsylvania Quakers speak against it. Even some Southern colonists know it's wrong. "What we build now," Father says, "will shape what America becomes. And I fear we're building on sand and blood."

I'm only fourteen, but I understand that I'm witnessing something terrible - the creation of a system that will divide our nation. I wonder if future generations will judge us harshly for what we allowed to happen, for what we didn't stop when we could have.
