Chapter 5. Resistance and Humanity.

Last week, three enslaved people escaped from Randolph's plantation. They disappeared into the forest, heading north. Randolph hired slave catchers with dogs to track them. Two were caught and whipped publicly as a warning. The third - a young man named Samuel - was never found. I hope he made it to freedom.

I've seen small acts of resistance everywhere once I started looking. Enslaved workers slow their pace when overseers aren't watching. They break tools "accidentally." They sing songs with hidden meanings about freedom and deliverance. One woman Father knows keeps a small garden where she grows African plants from seeds she somehow preserved across the ocean. These small acts preserve their humanity against a system designed to deny it.

At church, our minister preaches that slavery is God's will, quoting Bible passages about servants obeying masters. But Father showed me other passages about treating others as you'd want to be treated, about freedom and justice. "The Bible can be twisted to justify anything," he said. "You have to choose what kind of person you'll be."

Our family will never buy enslaved workers. We'll stay small farmers and do our own labor. It's not enough - we should speak out more boldly - but it's something. Father says every person must decide whether to participate in evil or resist it, even in small ways. I'm choosing resistance. Someday, I hope this terrible institution will end, though I fear it may take something catastrophic to uproot what we've planted so deeply.
