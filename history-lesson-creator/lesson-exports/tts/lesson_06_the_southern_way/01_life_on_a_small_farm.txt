Chapter 1. Life on a Small Farm.

My name is Thomas, and I am fourteen years old. My family owns a small tobacco farm in Virginia. We're not wealthy planters with hundreds of acres - we have just fifty acres and grow enough tobacco to make a modest living.

Unlike the huge plantations, we don't own enslaved workers. Father, my older brother William, and I do all the work ourselves. We plant in spring, tend the plants all summer, and harvest in fall. It's backbreaking work under the hot Virginia sun. Mother and my sister help with curing the tobacco leaves and running the household.

Most families in Virginia are like us - small farmers, not wealthy planters. But the big planters have the most power. They own thousands of acres and use enslaved African laborers to work their fields. These plantations produce most of Virginia's tobacco and make their owners very rich.

Father says the colony is changing. When he was young, most workers were indentured servants like in Jamestown. They worked for several years and then were free. But now, more and more planters are buying enslaved Africans who will never be free, nor will their children.
