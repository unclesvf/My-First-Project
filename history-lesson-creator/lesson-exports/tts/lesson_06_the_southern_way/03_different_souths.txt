Chapter 3. Different Souths.

The Southern colonies are different from each other. Virginia and Maryland grow tobacco. South Carolina grows rice in coastal swamps where the work is brutal and deadly. The rice fields must be flooded and drained, and workers labor in water up to their knees, plagued by mosquitoes and disease. The Carolinas have more enslaved workers than free people in some areas.

All Southern colonies have plantation economies, warm climates, and long growing seasons. The soil and climate are perfect for cash crops that sell for high prices in England: tobacco, rice, and later cotton. But these crops require intense labor, which is why planters turned to slavery.

The plantation system creates a rigid social structure. At the top are wealthy planters who own huge estates and enslaved workers. They control the government and make the laws. Below them are small farmers like my family. At the bottom are poor white workers and indentured servants. And below even them - treated not as people but as property - are the enslaved Africans.

This is different from New England, where most people are small farmers or merchants, or the Middle Colonies, where religious diversity and trade dominate. The South is building its wealth on slavery, and this choice will have terrible consequences that will echo for centuries.
