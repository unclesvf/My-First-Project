Chapter 2. Building an Army.

After Bull Run, the Union Army transformed. General George McClellan took command. He was young, energetic, and organized. "I will build the finest army the world has seen," he promised.

McClellan was good at training. He drilled us constantly. We learned to march in formation, load and fire rifles properly, dig entrenchments, follow orders. He built hospitals, supply systems, and fortifications around Washington. Raw recruits became soldiers.

But McClellan was overcautious. He always believed Confederate forces were larger than they were. He drilled us for months, preparing for a perfect campaign. Lincoln grew impatient. "If McClellan isn't going to use his army, I'd like to borrow it," Lincoln reportedly said.

Meanwhile, I was learning what war really meant. The camps were crowded, unsanitary, and disease-ridden. For every soldier killed in battle, two died from disease - typhoid, dysentery, measles. My friend William died of typhoid in camp, never firing a shot at the enemy.

Letters from home told of growing war weariness. People were shocked by casualty lists. The romance of war faded when fathers and sons started dying. But Lincoln insisted we must preserve the Union. The nation couldn't survive if states could leave whenever they disagreed with election results.

The war's purpose evolved too. At first, we fought to preserve the Union, explicitly not to free slaves. Lincoln feared alienating border states like Kentucky and Maryland if he made it about slavery. But as the war continued and we saw enslaved people fleeing to Union lines, asking for protection, the slavery question became unavoidable.

Some escaped slaves helped the Union cause, providing intelligence about Confederate positions, working as laborers, even guiding our troops. "Contraband," we called them - Confederate property now in Union hands. It was a legal fiction that avoided calling them free, but it recognized we couldn't send them back to slavery while fighting against their masters.

By early 1862, we were ready for a real campaign. McClellan planned to take Richmond by landing troops on the Virginia peninsula and advancing up toward the capital. The Peninsula Campaign would test whether we were truly ready for war.
