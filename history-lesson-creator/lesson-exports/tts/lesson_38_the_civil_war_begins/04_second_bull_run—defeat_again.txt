Chapter 4. Second Bull Run - Defeat Again.

After McClellan's Peninsula Campaign failed, Lincoln tried a new approach. He brought General John Pope from the West to command a new Army of Virginia. Pope was confident, even arrogant. "I have come to you from the West, where we have always seen the backs of our enemies," he announced.

August 1862. Lee and Stonewall Jackson outmaneuvered Pope at Second Bull Run - the same battlefield where we'd been defeated a year earlier. Jackson marched his forces around Pope's flank, attacked our supply depot, then positioned his troops along an unfinished railroad cut.

Pope attacked Jackson's position repeatedly, thinking he'd trapped Jackson. But Lee arrived with reinforcements. On the second day, while Pope focused on Jackson, Lee's other corps under James Longstreet hit our flank with 28,000 men. Our line collapsed. We retreated again to Washington, defeated at the same place we'd been beaten a year earlier.

I fought in those attacks against Jackson's position. We charged across open ground into rifle and artillery fire. Men fell by the hundreds. We'd reach the railroad cut, fight hand-to-hand, then be driven back. We attacked again and again, making no progress, losing friends with each assault.

When Longstreet's attack hit our flank, the retreat became a rout again. We fell back to Washington's fortifications, exhausted and demoralized. Pope was relieved of command. Lincoln, despite misgivings, restored McClellan to command. McClellan was cautious, but soldiers trusted him.

Then Lee made a bold move: he invaded Maryland. If he could win a victory on Northern soil, Britain and France might recognize the Confederacy. Maryland, a slave state, might join the Confederacy. A victory might swing the fall elections to Democrats who'd negotiate peace.

McClellan marched out to meet Lee. We were tired, depleted, and demoralized from defeats. But we were also angry. The Confederates had invaded our territory. This time we'd be defending our homes, not attacking theirs. The armies converged on a small Maryland town: Sharpsburg, along Antietam Creek.
