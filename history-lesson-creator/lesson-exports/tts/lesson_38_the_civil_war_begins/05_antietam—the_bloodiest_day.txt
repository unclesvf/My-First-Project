Chapter 5. Antietam - The Bloodiest Day.

September 17, 1862. Antietam. The bloodiest single day in American history. Twenty-three thousand men killed, wounded, or missing in twelve hours of fighting.

I was in the assault on the Sunken Road - later called Bloody Lane. Confederate infantry positioned in a natural trench fired volley after volley into our ranks as we advanced across an open field. Men fell in waves. We'd get close, fire, retreat, then attack again. For three hours we assaulted that position, bodies piling up. Finally, we flanked it and the Confederates retreated, leaving the sunken road filled with their dead and wounded.

Meanwhile, other battles raged. At the Cornfield, men fought back and forth through tall corn. The field changed hands multiple times. "Every stalk of corn was cut down as if by a knife," a soldier said later. At the Dunker Church, infantry and artillery tore the small building apart. At Burnside's Bridge, Union forces spent hours trying to cross a narrow stone bridge under Confederate fire.

The fighting was worse than anything I'd experienced. At Gaines' Mill or Second Bull Run, the battle was chaotic but spread across time and space. At Antietam, it was concentrated horror - thousands of men in a small area killing each other with rifles, artillery, and bayonets.

By evening, both armies were exhausted. Technically the battle was a draw - neither side clearly won. But Lee's invasion was stopped. He retreated back to Virginia, his Maryland Campaign failed. McClellan claimed victory but didn't pursue aggressively, frustrating Lincoln again.

But Antietam had enormous consequences beyond the battlefield. Lincoln had been waiting for a Union victory to announce a new policy. On September 22, five days after Antietam, he issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. On January 1, 1863, all slaves in states still in rebellion would be declared free.

The war's purpose transformed. We weren't just fighting to preserve the Union - we were fighting to end slavery. It changed everything. Britain and France, which had considered recognizing the Confederacy, couldn't support a nation fighting to preserve slavery. Enslaved people in the South began escaping to Union lines, seeking the freedom Lincoln promised. And Northern soldiers like me now fought for a moral cause, not just a political one.

Looking back, Antietam was the turning point. Not militarily - the war would continue nearly three more years. But morally and politically. After Antietam, the war became a war to end slavery. And that meant there could be no compromise, no negotiated peace that left the institution intact. The war would end only with Union victory and slavery's destruction. The bloodiest day led to the most important transformation - from a war to preserve the Union to a war for freedom.
