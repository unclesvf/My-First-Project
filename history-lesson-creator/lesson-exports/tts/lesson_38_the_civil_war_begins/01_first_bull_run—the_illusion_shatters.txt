Chapter 1. First Bull Run - The Illusion Shatters.

I'm Thomas, seventeen years old, and I enlisted in the Union Army in May 1861. The war fever in my hometown of Cleveland was intense. After Fort Sumter fell, President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers. Within days, thousands of men signed up, including me.

We were confident - cocky, even. We'd heard Southerners were inferior fighters, plantation aristocrats who'd never done hard work. We'd crush this rebellion in three months, march to Richmond, capture Jeff Davis, and be home by harvest. Our officers encouraged this thinking. "One good battle," they said, "and the Confederacy will collapse."

In July, we marched from Washington toward Manassas, Virginia, where Confederate forces gathered near a creek called Bull Run. It was slow going. Our regiment of volunteers had barely trained. We weren't soldiers yet - just farmers and clerks in uniforms.

The march felt like a picnic. Civilians from Washington followed in carriages, bringing picnic baskets and opera glasses to watch the battle. Congressmen came. Society ladies. They expected entertainment - a real battle to witness from a safe distance.

July 21, 1861. The battle began at dawn. At first, it went well. We pushed Confederate forces back. By afternoon, we seemed to be winning. Then everything fell apart.

Confederate reinforcements arrived - fresh troops led by General Thomas Jackson. Our forces attacked his position repeatedly. He wouldn't budge. "There stands Jackson like a stone wall!" a Confederate officer shouted. The name stuck - Stonewall Jackson.

More Confederate reinforcements arrived. They counterattacked. Our line broke. Someone shouted "Retreat!" and suddenly we were running. The retreat became a rout - panicked soldiers fleeing in disorder. Civilians who'd come to watch got caught in the chaos. Carriages overturned. Men abandoned weapons and equipment.

I ran too. I'm not proud of it, but when thousands of men are running and artillery shells are exploding, you run. We didn't stop until we reached Washington, exhausted and humiliated.

The battle taught us the war wouldn't be quick or easy. The Confederates were fighters. This would be a long, hard war.
