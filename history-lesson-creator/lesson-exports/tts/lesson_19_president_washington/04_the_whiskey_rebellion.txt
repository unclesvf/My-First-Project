Chapter 4. The Whiskey Rebellion.

In 1794, farmers in western Pennsylvania rebelled against Hamilton's whiskey tax. These frontier farmers grew grain and distilled it into whiskey - easier to transport than bulky grain sacks. The tax hit them hard, and they saw it as the same kind of unfair taxation Britain had imposed.

The rebels attacked tax collectors, burned buildings, and threatened armed resistance. This was the first major test of federal authority under the Constitution. Could the new government enforce its laws? Or would it collapse like the Articles of Confederation?

Washington's response was decisive. He personally led 13,000 militia troops to western Pennsylvania. The rebels melted away without a fight when they saw federal power backed by military force. Washington had proven that the Constitution wasn't just words on paper - the federal government had real authority and would use it.

I watched from my window as troops marched through New York on their way west. My father said this was the difference between Washington and a king. A king would have executed the rebels. Washington arrested a few leaders, but pardoned them. He'd shown strength without tyranny, enforcing law without revenge. That balance would become the American way.
