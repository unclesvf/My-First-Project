Chapter 1. A New Government Begins.

I'm Eleanor, fourteen, and I witnessed history today. George Washington took the oath of office as our first President on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York City. Thousands of people filled the streets, cheering and crying. Washington looked dignified but nervous - he knows the weight of this responsibility.

We're creating a government from scratch. No one has done this before. Washington must establish precedents that future presidents will follow. How should a president act? What powers should he have? How formal should the office be? Every decision Washington makes will shape the presidency forever.

Washington chose talented men for his cabinet: Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State, Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Knox as Secretary of War. But these men disagree on almost everything. The challenge won't just be governing - it will be keeping the government united.
