Chapter 2. Hamilton's Financial Plan.

Secretary Hamilton proposed a bold financial plan. The national government should assume all state debts from the Revolutionary War. We should create a national bank. We should encourage manufacturing. Hamilton believes a strong economy requires a powerful central government supporting business and industry.

But Thomas Jefferson and James Madison oppose this. They fear Hamilton wants to make America like Britain - urban, industrial, with a powerful central government favoring the wealthy. They believe America should remain a nation of independent farmers with strong state governments and limited federal power.

The debate grows bitter. Hamilton and Jefferson can barely stand to be in the same room. Washington tries to mediate, but even he can't bridge this divide. Two visions of America are emerging, and they're incompatible.
