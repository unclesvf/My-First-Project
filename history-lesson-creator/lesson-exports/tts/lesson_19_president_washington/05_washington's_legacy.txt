Chapter 5. Washington's Legacy.

When Washington left office in 1797, he'd served eight years as our first President. He could have served for life - many wanted him to. But he chose to step down, proving that American presidents would serve limited terms and transfer power peacefully. That decision may be his greatest gift to our republic.

Washington established so many precedents. He showed how a president should act: dignified but republican, not royal. He created the cabinet system. He asserted federal authority while respecting states' rights. He kept us out of unnecessary foreign wars. He held the government together despite bitter disagreements between Hamilton and Jefferson.

Most importantly, he proved that republican government could work on a large scale. Most of history's republics had been small city-states. Enlightenment philosophers doubted that a large republic could survive without collapsing into tyranny or chaos. Washington proved them wrong.

My father took me to see Washington's farewell parade. The man looked old and tired - eight years of presidency had aged him. But the crowd's love and respect were genuine. He'd won our independence as a general and secured it as a president. He was offered a crown and chose to be a citizen instead.

"That's the greatest act of his life," Father said, pointing at Washington's carriage disappearing down the street. "Not winning the war, not serving as president, but walking away from power when he could have kept it. That's what makes us different from every other nation. That's what makes us a republic." Watching Washington leave office peacefully, I finally understood what our experiment in self-government really meant. We had proven we didn't need kings. Citizens could govern themselves.
