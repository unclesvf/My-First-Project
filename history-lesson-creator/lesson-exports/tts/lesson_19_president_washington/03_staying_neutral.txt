Chapter 3. Staying Neutral.

In 1793, France and Britain went to war. France helped us win independence - shouldn't we help them now? But Washington declared neutrality. We're too weak for another war. We must stay out of European conflicts and focus on building our nation.

Many Americans were angry. Democratic-Republicans like Jefferson sympathized with France's revolution. Federalists like Hamilton favored Britain, our largest trading partner. But Washington stood firm: neutrality was essential for our survival.

Washington served two terms, then voluntarily stepped down - establishing the precedent that presidents shouldn't serve for life. In his Farewell Address, he warned against political parties and foreign entanglements. We didn't listen to either warning, but his example of peacefully transferring power became our greatest democratic tradition.
