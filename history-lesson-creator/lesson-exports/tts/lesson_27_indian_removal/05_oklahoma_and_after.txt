Chapter 5. Oklahoma and After.

We reached Indian Territory in March 1839. Of 16,000 who started, only about 12,000 arrived. Over 4,000 dead - a quarter of our people. And we're not the only ones - Creek, Seminole, Chickasaw, Choctaw all suffered similar removals. Tens of thousands of Native peoples died in what Americans blandly call "Indian Removal."

The land here is different from our Georgia mountains. We must start over with nothing - no homes, no tools, barely any food. We're supposed to be grateful for this "new start." We're told this land is ours "as long as grass grows and water runs." But we learned that American promises mean nothing when they want something we have.

Father survived the journey but is broken. "We tried everything," he says. "We adopted their ways, their language, their religion, their government. We appealed to their laws, their courts, their God. None of it mattered. They wanted our land, so they took it. That's the only truth."

I think about what we lost. Not just land and homes, but graves of ancestors, sacred sites, the mountains that held our history. We lost a quarter of our people. We lost our faith that justice and civilization mean anything in America. We learned that America's fine words about rights and law apply only to whites.

Future Americans will debate whether removal was justified, whether it was necessary for America's growth, whether it was really that bad. But I was there. I watched my grandmother and baby sister die on that trail. I saw four thousand of my people perish because white settlers wanted gold and cotton land. I know the truth: this was evil. America knew it was evil. And they did it anyway.

The United States calls itself a beacon of liberty, a nation founded on equality and rights. But liberty doesn't extend to us. Rights don't protect us. We've learned that American ideals are selective - they apply when convenient, disappear when inconvenient. The Trail of Tears taught us that in America, power matters more than justice, and white land hunger matters more than Cherokee lives.
