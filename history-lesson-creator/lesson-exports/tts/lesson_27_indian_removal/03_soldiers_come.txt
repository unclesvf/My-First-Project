Chapter 3. Soldiers Come.

Spring 1838. Soldiers arrive with guns and bayonets. General Winfield Scott commands 7,000 troops to round up Cherokee and force us west. They give us no time to gather belongings, to harvest crops, to bury our dead properly. We're herded like animals into stockades - temporary prison camps where we'll wait for the march west.

I watched soldiers drag families from homes. Old people, sick people, children - no one spared. Some whites who'd been waiting vultures descended on our property before we were even gone, claiming our houses, our fields, our livestock. Years of work, generations of home - stolen in moments.

In the stockades, conditions are terrible. Families crowded together, inadequate food and water, disease spreading. We wait through summer's heat in these camps. Some die before the journey even begins. The guards treat us like we're not human, like we're cargo to be shipped west.

Father tries to stay strong for us, but I see his despair. "We built everything Americans said to build," he says quietly. "We learned what they said to learn. We governed as they said to govern. And still they take everything." Mother holds us and prays, but I wonder if God hears Cherokee prayers.
