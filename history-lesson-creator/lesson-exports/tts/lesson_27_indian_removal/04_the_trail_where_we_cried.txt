Chapter 4. The Trail Where We Cried.

October 1838. We begin the thousand-mile march to Oklahoma. Over 16,000 Cherokee forced west in groups. It's cold already, and we're not prepared. Many have no shoes, no warm clothing. Food rations are inadequate. Water often contaminated. Dysentery, measles, whooping cough spread through our column.

We walk twenty miles a day when we can walk at all. The old and sick ride in wagons, but there aren't enough. People die every day. We bury them in shallow graves by the trail, marking them with stones if we have time. Sometimes we don't even have time for burial.

Grandmother died in November. Just got too tired, too cold, too sick. We buried her somewhere in Tennessee - I don't even know exactly where. Then my baby sister died of whooping cough. She was three years old. Mother wrapped her body and we buried her by the trail. We never even finished grieving for grandmother.

The whites we pass sometimes throw stones, shout insults. Others look away, ashamed. Some show pity but don't help. We're a people being destroyed, and America watches it happen. This isn't relocation - it's genocide disguised as policy. We call it "The Trail Where They Cried." In Cherokee: Nunna daul Tsuny.
