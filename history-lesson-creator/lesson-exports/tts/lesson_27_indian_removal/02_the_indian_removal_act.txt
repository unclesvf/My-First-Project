Chapter 2. The Indian Removal Act.

In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. President Jackson claims it's voluntary - tribes can choose to move west of the Mississippi to "Indian Territory" in exchange for their eastern lands. But everyone knows the truth: refuse, and you'll be forced out anyway.

Jackson argues removal benefits us. "Your Great Father," he calls himself patronizingly, says we'll be happier away from corrupting white influence. He promises land in the West will be ours forever, that we'll govern ourselves in peace. These are lies, and we know it.

Our leaders fight back through legal channels. Chief John Ross takes our case to the Supreme Court. In Worcester v. Georgia, the Court rules that we're a sovereign nation - Georgia has no authority over us. Chief Justice Marshall writes that our treaties are valid, our rights clear.

I remember Father's joy when news came: "The Supreme Court sided with us! American law recognizes our sovereignty!" But then Jackson supposedly said, "Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it." The President refuses to enforce the Court's ruling. Law means nothing when power opposes it. We've learned a terrible lesson: justice without enforcement is just words.
