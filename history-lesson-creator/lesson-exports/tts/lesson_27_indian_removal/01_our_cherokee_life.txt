Chapter 1. Our Cherokee Life.

I'm Sarah, fourteen years old, Cherokee. My people have lived in these Georgia mountains for generations - longer than anyone can remember. We're not the "savages" white people imagine. We have farms, schools, a written language created by Sequoyah, our own newspaper. Many Cherokee are Christians. We live in houses, wear European-style clothing, govern ourselves with a constitution modeled on America's.

My father farms cotton and corn. My mother weaves. I attend mission school where I'm learning English alongside Cherokee. We thought if we adopted "civilization," Americans would let us stay. We believed that education, Christianity, and farming would prove we deserved our land.

But Georgia wants our land, especially since gold was discovered here. White settlers squat on Cherokee property. Georgia extends its laws over us, ignoring that we're a sovereign nation with treaties guaranteeing our territory. President Jackson won't defend our rights, even though we helped him fight the Creek in 1814.

Father says Jackson despises Indians. He sees us as obstacles to white expansion, no matter how "civilized" we become. Our adoption of European ways means nothing to him. He wants our land for white settlers, and he'll use any means to get it.
