Chapter 3. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.

The constitutional changes aren't just at the state level. Congress is rewriting the U.S. Constitution to protect Black rights.

The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, makes us citizens. Before, the Dred Scott decision said Black people weren't citizens. The Fourteenth Amendment overturns that, declaring that all persons born in the United States are citizens. It guarantees equal protection under law and due process. States can't deprive citizens of rights without legal process.

This is monumental. Citizenship isn't just symbolic - it means legal standing. We can sue in court, claim constitutional protections, demand equal treatment. The amendment provides the constitutional foundation for civil rights.

The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in 1870, protects voting rights. It declares that the right to vote cannot be denied based on "race, color, or previous condition of servitude." Black men across the country can vote, not just in the South.

I watch as my father and other Black men vote for the first time in 1868. They line up outside the polling place, many wearing their best clothes, treating it as the solemn civic duty it is. White conservatives glare at them, angry that former slaves now have political power. But federal troops are there to protect the voters.

Father votes for Republican candidates - the party of Lincoln, emancipation, and Reconstruction. He's voting for men who will protect his rights and continue building a society based on equality.

That night, when the votes are counted, Republicans sweep the elections. Black men helped elect them. We're not just free - we're political participants with actual power to shape government. It's what freedom should mean: not just absence of slavery but presence of rights and political power.
