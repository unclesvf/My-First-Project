Chapter 5. The Reign of Terror.

But white conservatives won't accept this new order. They use violence to restore white supremacy and undo Reconstruction.

The Ku Klux Klan - a terrorist organization of former Confederates - spreads across the South. They wear white robes and hoods to hide their identities. They ride at night, attacking Black people who assert their rights and white Republicans who support Reconstruction.

In 1868, the Klan murders my neighbor, Samuel, a Black man who registered to vote. They dragged him from his home at night, beat him, and hanged him from a tree. His crime: political activism.

They leave his body hanging as a warning to other Black voters. The message is clear: assert your rights and you'll die.

The violence escalates before the 1868 election. The Klan attacks polling places, murders Black voters, burns Black churches and schools. In some areas, they kill dozens of Black people and white Republicans in coordinated campaigns of terror.

Father still votes, but he's frightened. We all are. Every Black person exercising their rights knows they might be the next victim. But many refuse to be intimidated. "They want us to be afraid," Father says. "If we surrender our rights out of fear, freedom means nothing."

Congress passes the Enforcement Acts and the Ku Klux Klan Act, giving the federal government power to protect Black voters and prosecute terrorists. President Grant sends federal troops to suppress the Klan. Hundreds of Klan members are arrested and tried.

For a while, the federal intervention works. Klan violence decreases. We have a few years of relative safety to vote and participate in government.

But we wonder how long it will last. Northern commitment to Reconstruction is wavering. Democrats campaign on ending "Negro rule" and restoring "home rule" - code words for white supremacy. Economic depression in the North makes Reconstruction seem less important. White Northerners who fought to end slavery are losing interest in protecting Black rights.

Reconstruction gave us citizenship, voting rights, and political power. But it didn't give us economic independence or change white Southerners' determination to maintain racial hierarchy. Everything we've gained depends on federal military protection and Northern political will. What happens when those fade?

I'm eighteen now, educated and hopeful but also realistic. We've made extraordinary progress, but it's under siege. The question isn't whether we deserve freedom and equality - we do, obviously. The question is whether America will defend those principles against violent opposition. The answer will determine not just Reconstruction's success but the meaning of American democracy itself.
