Chapter 1. Congress Takes Control.

I'm Eliza, sixteen years old, and I live in South Carolina. I was born enslaved but freed when I was thirteen, after the Civil War ended. The past three years have been chaotic - freedom without resources, Black Codes restricting our rights, President Johnson allowing former Confederates back into power.

But in March 1867, everything changed. Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts over President Johnson's veto. They took control of Reconstruction away from the President.

The Acts divided the former Confederacy into five military districts, each governed by a Union general. These generals have power to protect our rights and maintain order. Southern states must write new constitutions guaranteeing Black male suffrage - the right to vote. States must ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, making us citizens with equal protection under law. Only after meeting these requirements can states rejoin the Union.

It's radical - the federal government forcing states to guarantee Black voting rights. But it's also necessary. Presidential Reconstruction failed. Former slaveholders passed Black Codes and used violence to restore white supremacy. Only federal military power can protect our freedom.

In South Carolina, General Daniel Sickles is military governor. He invalidates the Black Codes, protects Black people's rights to testify in court, and ensures fair treatment. It's the first time in my life I've felt protected by law rather than threatened by it.

Most important: Black men can vote. My father registered to vote in 1867. He was almost fifty years old and had been enslaved his entire life. Now he's a voter with the power to choose representatives.

"I never thought I'd see this day," he said, showing me his voter registration certificate. "Free and a citizen with the right to vote." He cried - tears of joy and disbelief that freedom could mean this much.
