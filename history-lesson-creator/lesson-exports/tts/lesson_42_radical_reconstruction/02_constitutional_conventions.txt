Chapter 2. Constitutional Conventions.

Early 1868. South Carolina holds a constitutional convention to write a new state constitution. For the first time, Black men participate in government. Of 124 delegates, 76 are Black - a majority. Most were enslaved just two years ago.

I attend the convention's opening session in Charleston. The convention hall is packed - Black and white delegates, spectators, journalists. It's extraordinary seeing Black men debating law and policy, writing a constitution that will govern all South Carolinians.

The constitution they write is remarkably progressive. It establishes public schools for all children - Black and white - funded by taxes. It protects property rights and civil rights for all citizens. It gives Black men the right to vote and hold office. It's more democratic than the old constitution, which concentrated power in the hands of wealthy white planters.

Some delegates are highly educated - ministers, teachers, skilled craftsmen who were free before the war. Others are recently freed, with little formal education but keen intelligence and determination. Robert Smalls, a former slave who became a Civil War hero by capturing a Confederate ship and delivering it to the Union, is a delegate. So is Francis Cardozo, an educated minister who becomes Secretary of State.

White conservatives are furious. They call the convention "Negro rule" and the delegates ignorant. But the constitution the convention produces is sound, fair, and progressive. Voters ratify it overwhelmingly in 1868.

That same year, South Carolina elects a new legislature under the new constitution. Eighty-seven of 157 legislators are Black. It's the only state legislature in American history with a Black majority.

My father's friend Robert is elected to the state House of Representatives. He'd been a field hand, enslaved his entire life. Now he's a legislator making laws. "We're building a new South," he tells us. "A South based on equality and justice, not slavery and oppression."
