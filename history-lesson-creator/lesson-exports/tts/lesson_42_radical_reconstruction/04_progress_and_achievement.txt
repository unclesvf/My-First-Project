Chapter 4. Progress and Achievement.

The years 1868-1870 are a time of remarkable progress in South Carolina. Black men serve in the legislature, as sheriffs and judges, as members of Congress. Hiram Revels of Mississippi becomes the first Black U.S. Senator in 1870. Joseph Rainey of South Carolina becomes the first Black member of the House of Representatives. These men prove that Black people can govern effectively.

The Reconstruction governments invest in public education. Before the war, it was illegal to teach enslaved people to read. Now the state builds schools for Black and white children. The Freedmen's Bureau and Northern missionary societies help establish schools across the South.

I'm able to attend school for the first time. I'm sixteen and learning to read alongside younger children. It's humbling but wonderful. Our teacher is a Black woman from the North who came south to teach. She's patient and encouraging.

"Education is freedom," she tells us. "No one can take knowledge from you. Learn to read, and you can educate yourselves forever."

Black communities build churches, mutual aid societies, and political organizations. Churches become centers of community life - not just for worship but for education, political organizing, and mutual support.

We're also building economic independence. Some Black families buy land. Others open businesses. Father saves money working as a carpenter, hoping to buy our own farm someday. We're trying to build a foundation for future generations.

The progress feels fragile but real. For the first time, Black people in the South have legal rights, political power, and opportunities for education and economic advancement. We're building the society that should have existed from America's founding - one based on equality and democracy rather than slavery and racial hierarchy.
