Chapter 3. Encounters with Native Peoples.

The expedition's success depended entirely on Native peoples. We didn't discover anything - Native nations had lived in and traveled through these lands for thousands of years. They shared knowledge that saved our lives.

The Mandan people sheltered us through our first winter. They shared food, showed us how to hunt buffalo, taught us survival techniques. Without their hospitality, we would have starved or frozen.

Most tribes we encountered were peaceful and helpful, offering food, horses, and directions. They were curious about us, and we about them. Captain Lewis held councils, distributed gifts, and told tribes they were now under American authority. I don't think the tribes took this seriously - we were a small party passing through. They humored us.

But our presence foreshadowed what was coming. We were scouts for American expansion. Our maps would guide settlers, traders, and soldiers into these territories. The friendly tribes helping us didn't realize they were assisting in their own dispossession.

York, Captain Clark's enslaved servant, fascinated many tribes - some had never seen a Black person. York was a full member of our expedition, hunting, voting on decisions, equal in our hardships. But he remained enslaved, a contradiction that troubled me. How could we explore in the name of liberty while denying York his freedom?
