Chapter 6. What We Discovered.

The Lewis and Clark Expedition changed America's vision of itself. Before, Americans thought of their nation as confined to lands east of the Mississippi. After, they imagined a nation spanning the continent.

We brought back detailed maps, journals filled with scientific observations, specimens of unknown plants and animals. We'd documented over 170 plant species and 120 animal species unknown to science. We'd established diplomatic relations with Native tribes and charted rivers and mountains.

But our "discovery" came at a cost. We weren't exploring empty wilderness - we were mapping lands home to hundreds of thousands of Native peoples. Our expedition would guide American settlers, traders, and soldiers into these territories, beginning the dispossession of Native nations.

I think about Sacagawea, who helped us so much. She'd been kidnapped from her Shoshone people as a child, sold to a French trader. Her people had been pushed westward by tribes with guns. Now we were bringing more Americans with more guns, more diseases, more hunger for land. Our expedition was the opening chapter of a story that wouldn't end well for Native peoples.

Captain Lewis struggled with depression after the expedition and eventually took his own life. I sometimes wonder if the gap between our high ideals and harsh reality troubled him. We'd explored in the name of enlightenment and science, but we'd really been scouting for conquest.

Still, the expedition taught me something valuable: America is vast, diverse, and amazing. From the Mississippi to the Pacific, from plains to mountains, our continent holds wonders beyond imagination. We'd proven that Americans could undertake great endeavors and succeed through cooperation, perseverance, and respect for the land.

The West was no longer unknown. For better and worse, Americans would now flood across the continent we'd mapped. The age of western expansion was beginning, and we'd opened the door.
