Chapter 4. The Rocky Mountains.

Nothing prepared us for the Rocky Mountains. Jefferson hoped we'd find an easy passage - maybe a short portage between rivers. Instead, we found a seemingly endless range of rugged peaks.

The crossing nearly killed us. We struggled through snow in September, leading horses over treacherous mountain paths. Food ran out. We ate candles and portable soup. Some men wanted to turn back, but Captains Lewis and Clark pushed forward.

The Nez Perce people saved us. When we stumbled out of the mountains, starving and desperate, they fed us and guided us to rivers flowing west. They could have left us to die or killed us for our supplies. Instead, they showed mercy and hospitality. I'll never forget their kindness.

Crossing the Rockies destroyed Jefferson's dream of a transcontinental water route for trade. The mountains were too vast, too harsh. But the crossing taught us something valuable: this continent was grander and more diverse than we'd imagined. The West wasn't just a bigger version of the East - it was something entirely different.

Standing on the Continental Divide, looking west toward the Pacific, I felt both triumph and humility. We'd accomplished an amazing journey, but the land had defeated our presumptions. Nature was bigger than our ambitions. The West would shape us more than we'd shape it.
