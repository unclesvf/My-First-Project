Chapter 5. Reaching the Pacific.

On November 7, 1805, we finally saw it - the Pacific Ocean. "Ocean in view! O! the joy!" Clark wrote in his journal. We'd traveled 4,000 miles from St. Louis. We'd crossed plains, mountains, and rivers. We'd survived grizzly bears, starvation, disease, and accidents. And we'd made it.

We spent a miserable winter near the mouth of the Columbia River. Rain fell constantly. Our clothing rotted. Food was scarce. The ocean we'd worked so hard to reach brought endless storms and dampness. But we'd achieved our goal.

We built Fort Clatsop and waited for winter to pass. We documented plants and animals, wrote extensive journals, prepared for the return journey. Every member of the expedition - including York and Sacagawea - voted on where to build the fort. This democratic decision-making felt very American.

The journey back in 1806 was faster because we knew the route. When we reached St. Louis in September, people were amazed - most had assumed we'd died. We'd been gone 28 months, traveled 8,000 miles, and lost only one man (to appendicitis).

We'd failed to find a water route to the Pacific. But we'd succeeded in something greater: we'd mapped a continental nation. We'd proven Americans could reach the Pacific overland. We'd made contact with dozens of Native nations. We'd collected scientific specimens and geographical knowledge. We'd expanded American understanding of the West from myth to reality.
