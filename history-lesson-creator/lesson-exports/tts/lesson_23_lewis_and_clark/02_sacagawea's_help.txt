Chapter 2. Sacagawea's Help.

In North Dakota, we met Sacagawea, a Shoshone woman who joined us as interpreter and guide. She's about sixteen and carries her baby son on her back. Her presence signals peaceful intentions to tribes we meet - no war party travels with a woman and baby.

Sacagawea proved invaluable. She helped us communicate with tribes, identified edible plants, found routes through mountains. When we reached Shoshone territory, their chief was her brother! She helped us trade for horses we desperately needed to cross the mountains.

We reached the Pacific Ocean in November 1805. We'd traveled 4,000 miles through unmapped wilderness. We spent the winter near the coast, then returned, arriving back in St. Louis in September 1806. We'd been gone over two years. People thought we were dead!

Our expedition proved there's no easy water route to the Pacific - the Rocky Mountains block it. But we mapped vast territories, established American claims to the Pacific Northwest, made contact with Native peoples, and brought back knowledge of lands most Americans couldn't imagine.
