Chapter 1. Into the Unknown.

I'm William, seventeen, and I'm part of the greatest adventure in American history. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark are leading the Corps of Discovery - about 40 men - to explore the Louisiana Purchase and beyond, all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

President Jefferson gave Lewis specific orders: map the territory, find a water route to the Pacific, study plants and animals, establish relations with Native tribes. We left St. Louis in May 1804, traveling up the Missouri River in keelboats. None of us know what we'll find.

The land is beautiful and terrifying. We've seen buffalo herds stretching to the horizon, grizzly bears that attack without provocation, landscapes unlike anything in the East. We take detailed notes, collect specimens, draw maps. Every day brings new wonders and dangers.
