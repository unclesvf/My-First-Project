Chapter 3. The Bank War.

Jackson's biggest battle was against the Second Bank of the United States. This national bank, chartered by Congress, controlled much of the nation's money and credit. Jackson saw it as a corrupt monopoly that favored wealthy Eastern elites over common farmers and workers.

The Bank's president, Nicholas Biddle, was everything Jackson hated - educated, aristocratic, powerful. Biddle used the Bank's financial power to influence politics, extending credit to supportive newspapers and politicians while denying it to opponents. Jackson called the Bank "a hydra of corruption" and vowed to destroy it.

When Congress re-chartered the Bank in 1832, Jackson vetoed it. His veto message was powerful: the Bank gave special privileges to the wealthy, foreign investors, and Eastern elites. It concentrated dangerous economic power in private hands. Jackson painted it as democracy versus aristocracy, the people versus privilege.

The Bank War became the central issue of the 1832 election. Jackson won overwhelmingly, taking it as a mandate to destroy the Bank. He withdrew federal deposits and placed them in state banks - his opponents called them "pet banks." By 1836, the Second Bank's charter expired. Jackson had killed it.

Father celebrated - we hated the Bank's power over western farmers like us. But some warned that destroying the Bank removed restraints on reckless state banks, leading to inflation and economic chaos. They were right - the Panic of 1837 devastated the economy. Jackson's democratic impulses had unintended consequences.
