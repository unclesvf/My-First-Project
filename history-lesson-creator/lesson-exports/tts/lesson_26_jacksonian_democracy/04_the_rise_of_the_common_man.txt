Chapter 4. The Rise of the Common Man.

Jackson's presidency transformed American democracy. Before him, politics was dominated by wealthy, educated elites from established families. Jackson proved that a frontier-born, self-made man could become president. He spoke for farmers, workers, and western settlers - "the common man."

Voter participation exploded. In 1824, only about 27% of eligible voters participated in the presidential election. By 1840, it was over 80%. States eliminated property requirements for voting. Political parties held conventions where delegates nominated candidates, replacing the old system where party elites chose in secret caucuses.

Political campaigns became spectacles. There were parades, rallies, barbecues, and mass meetings. Politicians had to appeal directly to voters, not just to elite kingmakers. This made politics more democratic but also more populist - politicians told people what they wanted to hear, not always what they needed to hear.

I watched my father and his friends become politically engaged in ways their fathers never were. They attended rallies, debated policies, voted with pride. They felt that government finally represented them, not just the wealthy. This was Jacksonian Democracy in action - the political empowerment of ordinary white men.

But "common man" had limits. Women couldn't vote. Free Black men lost voting rights in many states. Enslaved people had no rights at all. Native Americans were being pushed westward. Jacksonian Democracy expanded political participation for white men while contracting it for others. The age of the common (white) man was built on exclusion as much as inclusion.
