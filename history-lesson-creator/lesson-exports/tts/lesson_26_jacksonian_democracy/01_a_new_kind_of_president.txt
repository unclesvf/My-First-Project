Chapter 1. A New Kind of President.

I'm Thomas, fifteen, from Tennessee. Today Andrew Jackson was inaugurated as President, and everything feels different. Jackson isn't from a wealthy Eastern family like previous presidents - he's from the frontier, like us. He's a war hero, a self-made man, someone who speaks for common people, not just the elite.

At his inauguration, thousands of ordinary people flooded Washington. They crowded into the White House, tracking mud on carpets, breaking china, standing on furniture to see "Old Hickory." The previous administration was horrified. But to us, it showed democracy in action - the people's President welcoming the people into the people's house.

Jackson believes in the "common man." He expanded voting rights - most states have dropped property requirements, so now most white men can vote regardless of wealth. Political power is spreading beyond the elite. This is "Jacksonian Democracy" - the idea that ordinary citizens should participate actively in government.
