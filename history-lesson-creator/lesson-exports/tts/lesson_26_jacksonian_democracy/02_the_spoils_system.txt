Chapter 2. The Spoils System.

Jackson introduced the "spoils system" - rewarding political supporters with government jobs. "To the victor belong the spoils," his supporters said. He fired many federal employees and replaced them with his own people.

Critics called this corruption - giving jobs based on loyalty rather than merit. But Jackson argued that government jobs aren't so complicated that ordinary men can't do them. Why should positions be reserved for an educated elite? Rotation in office prevents bureaucrats from becoming too powerful.

I see both sides. Father got a postmaster job because he supported Jackson - he's proud to serve. But the previous postmaster, who was competent, lost his job for political reasons. Democracy is messy. Expanding participation means empowering people who might not always make wise choices. But isn't that better than rule by an elite few?
