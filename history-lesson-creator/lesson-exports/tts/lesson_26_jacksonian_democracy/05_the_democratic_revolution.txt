Chapter 5. The Democratic Revolution.

Jackson's legacy is contradictory. He democratized American politics, making government more responsive to ordinary citizens. He fought economic elites and broke their monopoly on power. He proved that anyone - even a orphaned frontier boy - could rise to the presidency. He made Americans believe in themselves and their democratic system.

But he also concentrated power in the presidency, using vetoes and executive authority in unprecedented ways. He ignored Supreme Court decisions he disliked. He rewarded political loyalty over competence. His economic policies, while democratically popular, led to financial disaster. His Indian removal policy was genocidal.

Most troubling was what Jacksonian Democracy revealed about democracy itself. When "the people" rule, which people? The majority can oppress minorities. Popular policy isn't always wise policy. Charismatic leaders can manipulate democratic systems. Democracy requires more than majority rule - it needs protection for minority rights, limits on government power, and educated, engaged citizens.

Walking through Washington at Jackson's second inauguration, I saw America's democratic spirit unleashed. Thousands of ordinary people, dressed in their Sunday best, celebrated their president and their power. It was inspiring and a bit frightening. Democracy was no longer theoretical - it was real, messy, powerful, and unpredictable.

Father said it best: "Jackson proved government can serve common people, not just elites. But he also showed democracy's dangers - mob rule, demagoguery, majority tyranny. Future generations must take the good - political participation, opportunity, faith in common people - while avoiding the bad. That's the challenge of Jacksonian Democracy: harnessing the people's power without unleashing the people's worst impulses."

The age of the common man had arrived. America would never be the same. For better and worse, we'd proven that democracy could work on a large scale, that ordinary people could govern themselves. The world was watching, and we were showing them something new - government by the people, truly and messily.
