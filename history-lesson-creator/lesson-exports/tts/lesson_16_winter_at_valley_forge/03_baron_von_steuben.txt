Chapter 3. Baron von Steuben.

In February, Baron von Steuben arrives - a Prussian military officer who volunteers to train us. He doesn't speak English well, but he teaches us to march in formation, load muskets quickly, use bayonets effectively. He makes us into real soldiers.

Before von Steuben, we were farmers with guns. Now we drill every day, learning professional military tactics. It's hard work, but it gives us pride and purpose. We're becoming an army that can stand against British regulars.

By spring, we've survived. We're hardened, trained, disciplined. News arrives of a French alliance - France will support our cause with money, ships, and soldiers. The war isn't over, but we have hope now. Valley Forge didn't break us. It made us stronger.
