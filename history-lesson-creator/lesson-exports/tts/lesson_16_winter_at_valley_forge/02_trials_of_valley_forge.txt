Chapter 2. Trials of Valley Forge.

Valley Forge is hell on earth. We build crude log huts, twelve men crammed in each. The cold seeps through every crack. We have little food - sometimes just "firecake" (flour and water baked on stones) and watery soup. Men are dying of typhus, dysentery, and pneumonia. Of 12,000 men, 2,500 will die here.

I'm hungry all the time. My feet are wrapped in rags. I share a thin blanket with two others. At night, I hear men coughing, praying, weeping. Some give up and go home. Others steal from nearby farms. Washington struggles to hold the army together.

But we don't give up. We're fighting for something greater than ourselves - for liberty, for our families, for the idea that we can govern ourselves. Washington shares our suffering, refusing to stay in a warm house while his men freeze. His example keeps us going.
