Chapter 4. Daily Survival.

Every day at Valley Forge is a battle for survival. We wake before dawn to the sound of drums. Those healthy enough for duty drill or stand guard. The sick - and there are always hundreds sick - lie in the huts, shivering with fever. Our surgeon does what he can with almost no medicine or equipment.

Food is our constant obsession. On good days, we get meat and bread. On bad days - and there are many bad days - we get nothing but firecake. I've learned to catch rats to supplement our rations. I'm not proud of it, but I'll eat anything to stay alive.

The worst part is watching friends die. My bunkmate Samuel died last week from pneumonia. We buried him in a shallow grave on the hillside with dozens of others. There was no time for proper funerals. His parents will never know where he's buried or that he died fighting for liberty.

Yet somehow we endure. We tell stories around fires, sing songs, write letters home. We gamble with worthless Continental currency. We complain bitterly about Congress, about officers, about the cold, the hunger, everything. Complaining keeps us human. And through it all, we see Washington - he could be in a warm house, but he visits our huts, checks on the sick, shares our hardships. If he hasn't given up on us, we can't give up on ourselves.
