Chapter 1. Defeat and Despair.

I'm Joseph, seventeen, a soldier in General Washington's Continental Army. It's December 1777, and we've lost Philadelphia to the British. We're marching to winter camp at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Many soldiers have no shoes - I can track our route by bloody footprints in the snow.

We've been defeated at Brandywine and Germantown. The British sit warm in Philadelphia while we're headed to a frozen hillside with inadequate food, clothing, and shelter. Congress hasn't sent supplies or paid us. Some men are deserting. Others are too sick to walk. I wonder if we'll survive this winter, let alone win this war.
