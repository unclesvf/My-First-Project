Chapter 2. Life in the Factory.

I work twelve hours a day, six days a week in a garment factory making shirtwaists (women's blouses). The factory is on the eighth floor of a building with no fire escapes. Three hundred women and girls work here, crowded together at sewing machines.

We arrive at 7 a.m. The foreman locks the doors - he says it prevents theft and unauthorized breaks. We work until 7 p.m. with a thirty-minute lunch break. The air is thick with cotton dust. The noise from hundreds of sewing machines is deafening. In summer, the heat is unbearable. In winter, there's barely any heating.

I earn $6 per week - about 10 cents per hour. From that, I pay for thread and needles, which the company charges us for. If I make a mistake, they fine me. If I'm late, they dock my pay. I bring home maybe $5 per week, which I give to my mother to help pay rent and buy food.

The work is dangerous. Girls lose fingers in the machines. The foreman rushes us constantly - more production, faster work. If we can't keep up, we're fired and replaced immediately. There are always more immigrants desperate for work.

There are no safety regulations. No minimum wage. No maximum hours. No workers' compensation if you're injured. No child labor laws - girls as young as ten work alongside me. No unions allowed - the owner fires anyone who tries to organize.

This is the reality beneath the Gilded Age's golden surface. While Rockefeller and Carnegie build mansions with dozens of rooms, we live ten people to a two-room apartment. While Morgan finances billion-dollar corporations, we work twelve-hour days for poverty wages. The industrial revolution creates enormous wealth, but it doesn't reach the workers who produce it.
