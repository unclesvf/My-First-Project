Chapter 3. The Titans of Industry.

The men who control American industry are sometimes called "Robber Barons" - a term suggesting they stole their fortunes. Others call them "Captains of Industry" - leaders who built America's economy. The truth is complicated.

Andrew Carnegie is a good example. He immigrated from Scotland poor, worked in factories and telegraph offices, invested wisely, and built a steel empire. By 1890, his Carnegie Steel Company produces more steel than all of Britain. He sells it to railroads, construction companies, manufacturers. Steel frames make skyscrapers possible. Steel rails carry trains across continents.

Carnegie preaches the "Gospel of Wealth" - the idea that rich people should use their fortunes for public good. He builds libraries across America - free libraries where working people like me can educate ourselves. He donates to universities, museums, and concert halls. He writes that dying rich is dying in disgrace - wealth should be given back to society.

But Carnegie also crushes unions, pays workers poverty wages, and uses violence against strikes. In 1892, at his Homestead steel plant, workers struck for better wages. Carnegie's managers hired Pinkerton guards - private police - who shot striking workers, killing several. The strike was broken with state militia.

John D. Rockefeller built Standard Oil through ruthless competition. He undercut competitors' prices until they went bankrupt, then bought their companies cheap. He made secret deals with railroads for lower shipping rates, making it impossible for competitors to match his prices. He created a monopoly - one company controlling an entire industry.

Rockefeller made oil products cheaper and more widely available. Kerosene for lamps became affordable for ordinary families. But he destroyed competitors, bribed politicians, and concentrated enormous power in his own hands.

J.P. Morgan, the banker, financed major corporations and reorganized bankrupt railroads. He stabilized industries and made American business more efficient. But he also controlled enormous financial power, deciding which companies succeeded or failed.

These men built American industry, but they also exploited workers, crushed competition, and corrupted politics. The Gilded Age creates enormous wealth, but it concentrates it in a few hands while millions labor in poverty.
