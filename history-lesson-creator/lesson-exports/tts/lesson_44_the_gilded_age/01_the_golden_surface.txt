Chapter 1. The Golden Surface.

I'm Anna, fifteen years old, and I work in a garment factory in New York City. My family immigrated from Italy two years ago seeking opportunity in America. What we found was hard work, poverty, and inequality - but also a nation transforming before our eyes.

This era is called the Gilded Age - a name from Mark Twain's novel. "Gilded" means covered with a thin layer of gold. It looks beautiful on the surface but hides something cheaper underneath. That describes America in the 1890s perfectly.

The surface is golden indeed. America is industrializing at breathtaking speed. Railroads crisscross the continent - by 1890, we have 200,000 miles of track. Factories produce goods that would have taken months to make by hand. Inventions transform daily life: the telephone, electric lights, the phonograph, motion pictures.

Enormous corporations dominate the economy. John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil controls 90% of America's oil refining. Andrew Carnegie's steel company produces more steel than all of Britain. J.P. Morgan's banking house finances major corporations and railroads. These men are richer than anyone in American history.

American cities grow enormous. New York has skyscrapers - buildings ten stories tall made possible by steel frames and elevators. Chicago rebuilds after the Great Fire, becoming a modern metropolis. Streetcars and elevated trains move millions of people daily.

From a distance, it looks like a golden age of progress and prosperity. America is becoming the world's leading industrial nation, surpassing Britain. We're building a modern economy that will dominate the twentieth century.

But beneath the golden surface lies exploitation, poverty, and suffering. And I see it every day in the factory where I work.
