Chapter 4. Child Labor and Exploitation.

The worst aspect of the Gilded Age is child labor. Children as young as six work in mines, factories, and fields instead of attending school. I see it daily in the garment factory where ten-year-old girls work alongside me.

In coal mines, young boys work as "breakers" - sitting for twelve hours sorting coal, breathing dust that ruins their lungs. In textile mills, children crawl under machines to fix threads, risking being crushed if they're not fast enough. In glass factories, boys work near furnaces in extreme heat. Many are injured or killed.

There are no child labor laws. Factory owners prefer hiring children - they're cheaper than adults, easier to control, and their small hands can do delicate work. Families need children's wages to survive. My younger brother wanted to work rather than attend school because we need money for rent and food.

Reformers are starting to document these conditions. Journalist Jacob Riis photographs tenement life and child labor in his book "How the Other Half Lives." People are shocked to see how working families actually live. But changing laws is difficult when wealthy industrialists control politicians.

The Gilded Age has no safety regulations, no minimum wage, no workplace protections. Economic theory says the market should regulate itself - "laissez-faire" economics, meaning the government shouldn't interfere in business. If workers don't like conditions, they can quit. If they can't find better jobs, that's their problem.

But this ignores power imbalances. Workers need wages to survive. Employers can replace any worker easily when there are thousands of desperate immigrants. Individual workers have no power to negotiate. That's why workers are starting to organize unions - the only way to balance corporate power.

The question of the Gilded Age is whether America will continue letting corporations exploit workers without regulation, or whether government will intervene to protect workers' rights and welfare. That battle will define the Progressive Era to come.
