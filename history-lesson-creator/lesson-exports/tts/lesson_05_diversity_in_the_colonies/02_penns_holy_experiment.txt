Chapter 2. Penn's Holy Experiment.

My uncle moved to Pennsylvania, the new colony founded by William Penn, a Quaker. The Quakers are strange to us - they believe everyone is equal before God, they refuse to take oaths or fight in wars, and they let women preach in their meetings. In England, they're persecuted for these beliefs.

Penn got a huge land grant from King Charles II to pay off a debt the king owed Penn's father. Penn wanted to create a "holy experiment" - a place where people could worship freely and live in peace. He called his capital Philadelphia, which means "city of brotherly love."

Penn did something remarkable: he insisted on paying the Delaware Indians fairly for their land. He made treaties with them and tried to live in peace. His Quaker beliefs taught that all people were equal and that violence was wrong. For many years, Pennsylvania had better relations with Native Americans than any other colony.

Uncle writes that Pennsylvania attracts people from everywhere: English Quakers, German Lutherans, Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, Welsh Baptists. Like New York, it's a place where different people live together. The Middle Colonies are becoming known as the "bread basket" because we grow so much wheat and grain.
