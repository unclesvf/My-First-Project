Chapter 5. The Price of Tolerance.

Not everyone celebrates our diversity. Some ministers warn that tolerating false religions invites God's wrath. When a Catholic family moved onto our street, neighbors muttered about popish plots and foreign loyalties. I heard an English merchant complain that too many languages confuse commerce and divide communities.

Even William Penn's experiment in Pennsylvania faces challenges. Some English settlers resent his treaties with Indians, wanting to simply take the land. Penn's own Quaker principles - refusing to swear oaths or support military defense - create tensions with the English Crown. How can a colony survive without defending itself?

Yet for all its imperfections, religious tolerance has brought us prosperity. While other colonies fracture over religious disputes, we focus on trade and growth. Skilled craftsmen from across Europe choose the Middle Colonies because they can worship freely and work without persecution. Our diversity attracts talent.

I'm learning that tolerance isn't just kindness - it's practical wisdom. When people feel safe and valued, they contribute their best. They invest, build, and create. Perhaps Father is right: the Middle Colonies are showing America what it could become - not a place of one truth enforced by law, but a marketplace of ideas where many truths coexist. It's messy and sometimes uncomfortable, but it's also vibrant and free.
