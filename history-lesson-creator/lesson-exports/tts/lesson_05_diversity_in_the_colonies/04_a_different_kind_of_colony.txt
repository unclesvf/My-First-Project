Chapter 4. A Different Kind of Colony.

The Middle Colonies are different from New England and the South. In New England, the Puritans control everything - religion, government, daily life. They don't tolerate other beliefs. In Virginia and the South, wealthy plantation owners dominate, and slavery is growing.

But here in the middle, we have more freedom and more variety. We don't have one powerful church controlling everyone. We have many religions living side by side. We don't have huge plantations; we have family farms and busy port cities. We're not as strictly religious as New England, nor as dependent on slavery as the South.

Our economies are diverse too. New York has trade and shipping. Pennsylvania has farming and crafts. We export wheat, flour, bread - earning us the nickname "bread basket colonies." We also have lumber, furs, and iron. Our ports are busy with ships from around the world.

Father says the Middle Colonies represent America's future: a place where people from different backgrounds come together, where religious tolerance is valued, where trade and commerce create opportunity. I think he might be right. This diversity - people, religions, ideas - makes us strong and creative. We're building something new here, something the world hasn't seen before.
