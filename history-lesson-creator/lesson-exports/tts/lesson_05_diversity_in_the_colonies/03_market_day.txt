Chapter 3. Market Day.

Tuesday is market day at the dock, and I help Father sell goods from his warehouse. The waterfront buzzes with activity - ships arriving from London, Amsterdam, the Caribbean. Sailors speak in tongues I don't recognize, their skin bearing the sun of distant seas.

At the next stall, a German baker sells dark rye bread. Beyond him, a Jewish merchant displays fine fabrics brought from the Mediterranean. An African freedman trades furs he's collected from inland trappers. A French Huguenot woman sells cheese made from her family's dairy. We all conduct business together without suspicion or hatred.

Yesterday, I attended a wedding between an English Anglican and a Dutch Reformed girl. Some people frowned - mixing religions causes conflict, they say - but most celebrated with the couple. Their children will carry both traditions, adding another thread to our colony's tapestry.

This stands in sharp contrast to what I hear about other colonies. In Massachusetts, they hang Quakers and banish anyone who disagrees with their church. In Virginia, only the Church of England is permitted. But here, on any given Sunday, you can hear church bells from a dozen different congregations, each worshipping God in their own way. Father calls this our greatest achievement.
