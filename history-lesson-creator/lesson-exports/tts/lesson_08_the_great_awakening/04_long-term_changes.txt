Chapter 4. Long-Term Changes.

The Great Awakening created lasting changes in colonial society. New denominations formed - Baptists and Methodists grew rapidly. New colleges would be founded to train revival-minded ministers - Princeton was established just a few years later in 1746, and others would follow in coming decades. The emphasis on personal choice and individual conscience planted seeds of independent thinking.

It also exposed the gap between religious ideals and social reality. If all people truly were equal in God's eyes, how could we justify slavery? How could we accept rigid social hierarchies? Some ministers began preaching against slavery, though they remained a minority.

Most importantly, the Awakening taught colonists to think for themselves and question authority. If established church leaders could be wrong about salvation, couldn't political leaders be wrong about governance? This wasn't a direct cause of the Revolution, but it created a mindset that valued personal conviction over inherited authority.

As I think back on that day when Whitefield preached, I realize I witnessed a transformation. Not just individual conversions, but a change in how Americans understood authority, community, and individual rights. We were becoming a people who believed in choosing our own paths - in religion, and eventually, in politics too.
