Chapter 2. Old Lights vs. New Lights.

Whitefield's visit divided our community. Some people, now called "New Lights," embraced this emotional, personal religion. They attended revival meetings, shared testimonies of their conversion experiences, and questioned whether ministers who hadn't been "born again" should even preach.

A famous minister from Northampton, Massachusetts - Reverend Jonathan Edwards - came to preach at our meetinghouse. His sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" described hell so vividly that people clutched their pews in terror, and some fainted from fear. His words gave powerful support to the revival. But other ministers, the "Old Lights," condemned this emotional excess.

The Old Lights said religion should be orderly, rational, and traditional. They accused revivalist preachers of stirring up dangerous emotions and undermining proper church authority. They pointed out that some revival meetings became chaotic, with people shouting, fainting, and claiming divine visions.

My family split over this. Father and Mother became New Lights, attending emotional prayer meetings. My uncle remained an Old Light, saying the revivals were dangerous enthusiasm. At Sunday dinner, they argued about whether true religion came from the head or the heart. I listened, uncertain which path was right.
