Chapter 5. Finding My Own Voice.

Three years have passed since Whitefield's visit, and I'm seventeen now. The Great Awakening changed me in ways I'm still discovering. I joined a New Light congregation that meets in a barn because we left the established church. Here, I've found something remarkable: my voice matters.

Last month, I spoke at our meeting about my faith journey. A woman - me, barely more than a girl - speaking about theology before the congregation! In the old church, only the minister spoke. Women sat silently. But in our revival meetings, the Spirit moves whom it will, and personal testimony carries weight regardless of who speaks.

Mother worries this makes me too bold. "Women should be modest and quiet," she reminds me. But she herself attends these meetings where women pray aloud and share their experiences. The Great Awakening opened a door it cannot now close - once you taste religious freedom and personal authority, you can't pretend you never did.

I see connections Uncle refuses to acknowledge. If I can interpret Scripture for myself, why can't colonists interpret their political rights? If no minister has absolute authority over my soul, does any king have absolute authority over my freedom? The Awakening taught us to value individual conscience over inherited tradition, to question authority, to believe in equality before God. These lessons extend beyond the meetinghouse. I don't know where this new spirit will lead America, but I know we've changed. We've learned to think for ourselves, and that knowledge is powerful and dangerous - a fire that, once lit, cannot easily be extinguished.
