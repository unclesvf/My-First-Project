Chapter 3. A Democratization of Religion.

The Great Awakening changed how people thought about authority - both religious and political. If ordinary people could have direct access to God without needing educated ministers to interpret for them, what other authority could be questioned?

New congregations formed when people left churches whose ministers they felt were unconverted. Previously, you belonged to the church in your town. Now people chose their church based on personal conviction. This was a radical form of religious freedom.

The revival also crossed social boundaries in surprising ways. Women spoke publicly about their faith experiences. Enslaved people attended revivals and some even became preachers. Young people challenged their elders. The educated elite no longer automatically controlled religious life.

I saw this myself when an enslaved man named Samuel preached at a revival meeting. He spoke with such power about God's love for all people, regardless of their earthly station. Some white people were scandalized, but others were moved to tears. How could we claim all souls were equal before God while keeping some people in bondage? The contradiction became impossible to ignore.
