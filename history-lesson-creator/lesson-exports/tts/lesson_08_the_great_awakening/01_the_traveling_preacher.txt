Chapter 1. The Traveling Preacher.

My name is Sarah, and I am fourteen years old. Today, something extraordinary happened in our small Connecticut town. A traveling preacher named George Whitefield came to speak, and everything changed.

We gathered in a field because no church could hold the crowd. Thousands of people came - farmers, merchants, servants, even enslaved people from nearby estates. Our ministers usually read sermons in quiet, scholarly voices. But Whitefield was different.

He preached with passion and emotion, tears streaming down his face. His voice carried across the field like thunder. He spoke of sin and salvation, heaven and hell. He said it didn't matter if you were rich or poor, educated or ignorant - everyone needed to be "born again" through personal faith in Jesus Christ.

People around me began to weep and cry out. Some fell to their knees. My mother wept openly, something I'd never seen. Even Father, usually so reserved, looked shaken. Whitefield said we couldn't earn salvation through good works or church attendance - we needed a direct, personal experience of God's grace. This was revolutionary.
