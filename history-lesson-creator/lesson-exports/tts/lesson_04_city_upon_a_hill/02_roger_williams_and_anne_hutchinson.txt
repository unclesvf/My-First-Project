Chapter 2. Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson.

Not everyone agreed with our strict ways. Roger Williams, a young minister, preached that the government shouldn't enforce religious laws. He said colonists should pay Native Americans for their land, not just take it. He believed in separation of church and state.

The authorities banished him. He fled south in winter and was saved by the Narragansett people. He founded Rhode Island, where people could worship freely. Some called it "Rogue's Island" because it tolerated all beliefs.

Then came Anne Hutchinson. She held Bible study meetings in her home where she questioned some of our ministers' teachings. Women listened to her ideas about salvation and grace. The authorities said she was dangerous - how could a woman presume to teach theology?

They put her on trial. I watched from the back of the meetinghouse as she defended herself brilliantly, using Scripture to answer every charge. But it didn't matter. They banished her too. She went to Rhode Island, and later to New York, where she was killed in a raid. Many said it was God's judgment, but I wonder if God really punishes people for thinking differently.
