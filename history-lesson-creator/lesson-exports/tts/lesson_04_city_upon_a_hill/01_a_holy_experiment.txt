Chapter 1. A Holy Experiment.

My name is John, and I am thirteen years old. My father is a Puritan minister who came to Massachusetts Bay with Governor John Winthrop. Unlike the Pilgrims at Plymouth, we didn't want to separate from the Church of England - we wanted to purify it from within.

Governor Winthrop told us we were building a "city upon a hill," a model Christian community that the world would look to as an example. This was not just about religious freedom for us - it was about creating God's perfect society in the New World.

We arrived with about 1,000 colonists, far more than Plymouth started with. We had money, supplies, and educated leaders. The Massachusetts Bay Company charter gave us the right to govern ourselves, and we brought the charter with us to America. This meant England couldn't easily control us from across the ocean.

But our "freedom" came with strict rules. Everyone had to attend our Puritan church. We had no tolerance for other beliefs. Father says that true freedom means freedom to do what is right, not freedom to do what is wrong. I sometimes wonder about this.
