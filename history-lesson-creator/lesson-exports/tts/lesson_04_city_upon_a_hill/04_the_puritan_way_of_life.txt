Chapter 4. The Puritan Way of Life.

Our colony thrived despite these controversies. We built towns around meetinghouses and common greens. Education mattered deeply to us - every town with 50 families had to hire a schoolmaster. In 1636, we founded Harvard College to train ministers.

We established a covenant community where church members could vote and hold office. It wasn't democracy for everyone - you had to be a male church member - but it gave many men a voice in government. Our town meetings became a foundation of American self-government.

We created laws based on the Bible, our "Puritan ethic" of hard work, thrift, and moral living. We wore plain clothes, avoided frivolity, and worked six days a week. Sunday was the Sabbath - a day of rest and worship where no work was permitted.

By 1640, about 20,000 colonists lived in Massachusetts Bay. We were the largest and most powerful New England colony. But I've learned that building a "city upon a hill" is harder than it sounds. How do you create a perfect society when people disagree about what perfection means?
