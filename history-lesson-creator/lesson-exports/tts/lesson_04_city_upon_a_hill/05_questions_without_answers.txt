Chapter 5. Questions Without Answers.

Now at seventeen, I've watched our colony grow from a holy experiment into something more complex. We banished Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson for their beliefs, yet we ourselves fled England to escape religious persecution. Father says this is different - we enforce God's true will - but the contradiction troubles me.

I've seen Winthrop's vision of charity and community produce remarkable things. When families struggle, neighbors help with barn-raisings and harvest. When sickness strikes, we care for each other. Our schools ensure even common children can read Scripture. These are noble achievements that spring from our shared covenant.

Yet I've also seen how our certainty can become cruelty. We banish dissenters and brand those who question our authority. We execute those we suspect of witchcraft. We take Native lands while calling ourselves righteous. The gap between our ideals and our actions weighs upon my conscience.

Father tells me doubt is the Devil's whisper, but I believe these questions matter. Perhaps a "city upon a hill" isn't about perfection - it's about striving, failing, and learning. The world watches us not to copy us exactly, but to learn from both our successes and our mistakes. That legacy may be more valuable than the perfect society we sought to build.
