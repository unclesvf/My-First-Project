Chapter 3. Sundays and Scrutiny.

Living in our "city upon a hill" means constant watchfulness - of ourselves and our neighbors. Last Sunday, the Goodman family was fined for their son laughing too loudly during services. Father says frivolity has no place in worship, but sometimes I wonder if God truly frowns upon a child's joy.

Our Sabbath begins Saturday evening at sunset and continues until Sunday sunset. We cannot cook, travel, play, or work. We attend two long services, each lasting three hours or more. Father preaches about sin and salvation while the congregation sits on hard benches in the unheated meetinghouse. In winter, my fingers grow numb holding my Bible.

The tithing man walks up and down the aisles with a long pole. One end has a feather to tickle awake drowsy women; the other end has a hard knob to rap the heads of sleeping men. I've felt that knob twice, and it hurts far worse than the shame.

We must dress modestly always - no bright colors, no lace, no jewelry. Mother wears only gray and brown. When a woman from England visited wearing a purple ribbon, the magistrates made her remove it publicly. They said such vanity invites the Devil's attention. I see how people's eyes follow anyone who seems different, marking them for correction.
