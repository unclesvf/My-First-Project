Chapter 2. The Starving Time.

The winter of 1609 brought horror beyond imagination. We called it the "Starving Time." Captain Smith had been injured and returned to England, leaving us without strong leadership. The Powhatans, tired of our demands for food, stopped trading with us and surrounded the fort.

We were trapped. We ate our horses first, then rats and mice. When those ran out, we boiled our leather boots and belts. People died every day - from hunger, from disease, from despair. Of the 500 colonists who started that winter, only 60 of us survived to see spring.

I survived by eating anything I could find. I dug for roots outside the fort walls at night, risking attack. I watched friends waste away, their eyes hollow and their bodies skeletal. We buried so many people that we ran out of space in the graveyard.

In June 1610, supply ships arrived. Lord De La Warr brought food, new colonists, and renewed hope. We had been ready to abandon Jamestown and return to England, but these supplies saved the colony. Still, the memory of that winter haunts me even now.
