Chapter 4. The First Representative Government.

In 1619, something remarkable happened. The Virginia Company allowed us to form the House of Burgesses, the first representative assembly in the American colonies. We could elect burgesses to make local laws, as long as they didn't contradict the company's rules or English law.

For the first time, colonists had a voice in their own government. We discussed matters like tobacco prices, land distribution, and relations with the Powhatans. It wasn't full democracy - only property-owning men could vote - but it was a start. This small seed of self-government would grow over time.

That same year, a Dutch ship arrived carrying about twenty Africans. They were sold as indentured servants, like me, expected to work for a set number of years and then be free. We didn't know it then, but this marked the beginning of something dark - the system of slavery that would eventually replace indentured servitude.

Now, as I near the end of my seven years of service, I look at Jamestown with mixed feelings. We survived the impossible. We created a permanent English colony in America. But at what cost? So many died. We took land from the Powhatans. And I fear the seeds of slavery we've planted will bear bitter fruit.
