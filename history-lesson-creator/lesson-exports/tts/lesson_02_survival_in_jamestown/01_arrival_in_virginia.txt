Chapter 1. Arrival in Virginia.

My name is Samuel, and I am fourteen years old. I came to Virginia as an indentured servant, bound to work for seven years in exchange for passage to this new land. The Virginia Company promised riches and opportunity, but what I found was something very different.

When our ship sailed up the James River in the spring of 1609, I saw a small fort surrounded by endless forests. About 200 colonists lived here, and they looked thin and weary. The gentlemen who led us wore fine clothes but knew nothing of farming or building. They expected to find gold like the Spanish had in Mexico.

Captain John Smith ran the colony with strict rules: "He who does not work, shall not eat." This angered many of the gentlemen who thought manual labor beneath them. But Smith knew we had to work together to survive, or we would all perish.

The fort's walls were made of logs, and inside stood a church, a storehouse, and crude houses. Beyond the walls lived the Powhatan people, led by their powerful chief. We depended on them for corn and knowledge of this strange land.
