Chapter 3. Tobacco Saves the Colony.

A man named John Rolfe changed everything when he began growing tobacco. He experimented with seeds from the Caribbean, creating a variety that grew well in Virginia's soil and tasted sweet when smoked. The English couldn't get enough of it.

Suddenly, we had found our gold - not the metal kind, but green leaves that brought profit. Everyone wanted to grow tobacco. Fields replaced forests. Even the streets of Jamestown were plowed up to plant more. We shipped barrel after barrel to England, and money poured back.

But tobacco required intense labor. The work was backbreaking: planting, weeding, picking, curing. We indentured servants worked from sunrise to sunset. The Virginia Company brought more and more servants from England - poor people like me who traded years of their lives for a chance in America.

John Rolfe also married Pocahontas, daughter of Chief Powhatan. This marriage brought peace between us and the Powhatans, at least for a while. She took the Christian name Rebecca and even traveled to England, where she was treated like royalty. Her marriage showed that perhaps our two peoples could coexist.
