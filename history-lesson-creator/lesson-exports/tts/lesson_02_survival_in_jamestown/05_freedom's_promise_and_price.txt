Chapter 5. Freedom's Promise and Price.

Today I am twenty-four years old. Three years ago I completed my seven years of indenture and became a free man. Master Thompson gave me my freedom dues: fifty acres of land, tools, seed corn, and two sets of clothes. I own nothing else, but I own myself, and that means everything.

In these three years since my freedom, I've built a small cabin on my land, about ten miles upriver from Jamestown. The soil is good for tobacco, and through hard work, I've begun to prosper. Some former servants have become successful planters themselves, even serving in our new House of Burgesses, which was established just this year. In Virginia, a man can rise through his own labor - a chance I'd never have had in England.

Yet I see troubling changes. This year, a ship brought about twenty Africans to our shores. They were sold as workers, and I fear planters will increasingly prefer enslaved laborers over indentured servants like I once was. Unlike me, these Africans may never earn their freedom. Already, I see planters treating African workers differently than they treated English servants. I fear that in time, this bondage will become permanent and hereditary, creating a society built on injustice that can never be escaped.

As I work my tobacco fields, I think about Jamestown's legacy. We proved English people could survive in America. We established representative government. We found economic success. But we also displaced the Powhatans, suffered terrible loss, and now embrace a system of forced labor that troubles my conscience. Our colony is both a triumph and a tragedy - a pattern that will follow America for centuries to come. I'm free now, but I wonder: what kind of freedom are we building here?
