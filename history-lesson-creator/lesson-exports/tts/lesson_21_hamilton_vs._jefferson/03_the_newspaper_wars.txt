Chapter 3. The Newspaper Wars.

The party battle plays out in newspapers. Hamilton secretly funds the Gazette of the United States, edited by John Fenno, which publishes Federalist views. Jefferson supports the National Gazette, edited by Philip Freneau, which attacks Federalist policies.

The papers don't just disagree - they attack viciously. The Gazette of the United States claims Jefferson wants mob rule and chaos. The National Gazette accuses Hamilton of wanting to establish a monarchy and destroy republican government. They question each other's motives, integrity, and patriotism.

I read both papers at our general store, watching neighbors argue over the articles. One Federalist paper claimed Jefferson was a dangerous radical influenced by the bloody French Revolution. A Democratic-Republican paper responded that Hamilton wanted to create an American aristocracy and turn workers into wage slaves.

Father shakes his head at the vitriol. "Washington warned against political parties," he says. "Now look at us - we're tearing ourselves apart." But he still reads the Democratic-Republican papers and nods along with their attacks on Hamilton. Nobody seems immune to the partisan fever.
