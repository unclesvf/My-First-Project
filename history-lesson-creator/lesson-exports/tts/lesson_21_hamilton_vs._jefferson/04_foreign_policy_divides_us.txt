Chapter 4. Foreign Policy Divides Us.

The French Revolution makes our divisions worse. In 1789, France overthrew its monarchy, claiming to follow America's example. Jefferson and his supporters celebrate - France is becoming a republic! But when the revolution turns violent with mass executions and radical policies, Federalists are horrified.

Then France and Britain go to war in 1793. We have a treaty with France from the Revolution - should we help them? Jefferson thinks we have an obligation. Hamilton says the treaty was with the French monarchy, which no longer exists, and besides, we're too weak to fight Britain.

Washington declares neutrality, making both sides angry. Democratic-Republicans accuse him of abandoning our French allies who helped us win independence. Federalists say he's being too cautious about offending France.

When Washington sends John Jay to negotiate a treaty with Britain, Democratic-Republicans are furious. The Jay Treaty settles some disputes with Britain but gives them favorable trade terms. Father and his friends burn John Jay in effigy in our town square. "We're crawling back to Britain!" they shout. "We're betraying France and the principles of liberty!"

I'm learning that foreign policy isn't just about other countries - it's about our identity. Federalists see Britain as a model: orderly, prosperous, stable. Democratic-Republicans see France: revolutionary, democratic, fighting against monarchy and aristocracy. Our foreign friendships reflect which America we want to be.
