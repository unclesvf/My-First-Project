Chapter 2. Political Parties Form.

Hamilton's supporters call themselves Federalists. They're mostly merchants, bankers, manufacturers, and wealthy landowners from cities and northern states. They want a strong, active federal government.

Jefferson's supporters call themselves Democratic-Republicans (or just Republicans, not related to today's Republican Party). They're mostly farmers, planters, and working people from the South and West. They want limited federal government and strong states' rights.

The two parties fight viciously. Federalist newspapers call Jefferson an anarchist who'll destroy order. Democratic-Republican papers call Hamilton a monarchist who wants to crown himself king. The attacks get personal and nasty.

Father supports Jefferson - we're Virginia farmers who value independence and fear distant government power. But our neighbor supports Hamilton, believing strong central government is necessary. Their friendship has become strained. Politics is dividing communities, even families.
