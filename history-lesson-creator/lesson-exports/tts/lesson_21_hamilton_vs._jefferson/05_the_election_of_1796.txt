Chapter 5. The Election of 1796.

When Washington retires, the first true partisan presidential election happens in 1796. Federalist John Adams runs against Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson. There are no national campaigns - the candidates don't travel or give speeches. But their supporters wage vicious newspaper wars.

Federalist papers say Jefferson is an atheist who'll destroy religion, a radical who'll bring French-style chaos and bloodshed to America. They claim he's weak on defense and will leave us vulnerable to foreign threats.

Democratic-Republican papers say Adams wants to be king, that he'll crush liberty and create an aristocracy. They accuse Federalists of favoring the wealthy over ordinary people, Britain over America's true interests.

Adams wins narrowly, and under the old system where the second-place finisher becomes vice president, Jefferson becomes Adams's VP. Imagine - the president and vice president from opposing parties, who despise each other's vision for America!

Father is disappointed but not defeated. "We'll win next time," he says. "More and more people are seeing that Federalists serve the rich, not the people." Our neighbor, a Federalist, warns that Democratic-Republicans will ruin the country with mob rule. Neither side can imagine the other might have valid points.
