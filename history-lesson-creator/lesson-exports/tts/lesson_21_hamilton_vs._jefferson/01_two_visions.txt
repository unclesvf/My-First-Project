Chapter 1. Two Visions.

I'm Samuel, fifteen, and I'm learning that America has two completely different visions for its future. Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson can't agree on anything, and their disagreements are splitting the nation.

Hamilton wants America to become like Britain: urban, industrial, commercial. He supports a strong federal government, a national bank, tariffs to protect manufacturers, and close ties with Britain. He believes the wealthy and educated should lead society. He trusts central power.

Jefferson wants America to remain a nation of independent farmers. He supports strong state governments, strict limits on federal power, no national bank, and friendship with France. He believes ordinary people can govern themselves. He fears centralized power leads to tyranny.

These aren't just policy disagreements - they're fundamental disagreements about what America should be. And they're creating the first political parties, something the Founders hoped to avoid.
