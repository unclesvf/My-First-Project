Chapter 3. The Vote for Independence.

On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence. Twelve colonies voted yes; New York abstained but later agreed. July 2 is actually Independence Day, though we'll celebrate July 4, when the Declaration was formally adopted.

The debates were intense. Some delegates feared we couldn't win against Britain. Others worried about what came next - how do you build a nation from scratch? But the momentum was unstoppable. After Lexington, Bunker Hill, and a year of war, there was no turning back.

On July 4, the Congress adopted the Declaration. Church bells rang. Crowds gathered. The document was read aloud to cheering citizens. In New York, soldiers toppled a statue of King George III. We've burned our bridges. We're no longer fighting for our rights as British subjects - we're fighting for independence as a new nation: the United States of America.
