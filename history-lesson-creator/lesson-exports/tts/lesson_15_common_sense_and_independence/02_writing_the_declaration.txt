Chapter 2. Writing the Declaration.

On June 7, Richard Henry Lee proposed that "these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States." The Congress appointed a committee to draft a declaration: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and two others.

Jefferson did most of the writing. I saw him around Philadelphia, looking tired and worried. He wrote at a portable desk in his rented room, choosing each word carefully. He based it on Enlightenment ideas - natural rights, consent of the governed, the right to alter or abolish government.

The Declaration lists grievances against King George III, but the most powerful part is the beginning: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

These words will change the world. They don't just justify our rebellion - they express universal principles about human rights and government. Though I notice the irony: we say all men are created equal while many colonists own slaves. This contradiction will haunt our new nation.
