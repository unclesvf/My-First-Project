Chapter 1. Common Sense.

My name is Hannah, and I am sixteen years old. My father is a delegate to the Continental Congress meeting here in Philadelphia. In January, a pamphlet called "Common Sense" by Thomas Paine swept through the colonies like wildfire. Father brought a copy home, and I read it with amazement.

Paine writes in plain language anyone can understand. He argues that it's absurd for a continent to be governed by an island, that hereditary monarchy is unjust, that America should be independent. His words are revolutionary: "The birthday of a new world is at hand."

Before "Common Sense," many colonists hoped to reconcile with Britain. We wanted our rights as British subjects restored. But Paine argues we should be our own nation. Within months, 120,000 copies sold in a population of 2.5 million. Everyone is talking about independence now.
