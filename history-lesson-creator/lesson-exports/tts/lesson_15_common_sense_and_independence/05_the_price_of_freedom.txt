Chapter 5. The Price of Freedom.

After the signing, Benjamin Franklin reportedly said, "We must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately." He meant it literally. By signing the Declaration, fifty-six men committed treason against Britain. If we lose this war, they'll be executed.

I've watched the strain on Father's face. Some signers have already paid dearly. British troops have burned homes, confiscated property, and imprisoned family members. These men have pledged "our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor" to this cause. They're risking everything for an uncertain future.

And it's not just the signers. Every soldier in the Continental Army is now a traitor to Britain. Every citizen supporting independence risks punishment. We've chosen a dangerous path. We're fighting the most powerful empire on Earth, with the world's strongest navy and a professional army. Our chances seem slim.

But Father says some things are worth any price. "We're not just fighting for ourselves," he told me. "We're fighting for the principle that people have the right to govern themselves. If we succeed, we'll prove that ordinary people can create their own government based on reason and rights, not tradition and force. That idea will change the world."

Standing in Independence Hall as the Declaration was read, I felt the weight of history. We've started something that won't end with this war. We've proclaimed ideals that will challenge tyranny everywhere. We've declared not just our independence, but humanity's right to freedom. Whatever happens next, there's no going back. We're Americans now, and we're free - or we'll die trying.
