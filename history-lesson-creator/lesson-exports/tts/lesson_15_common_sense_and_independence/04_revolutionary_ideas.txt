Chapter 4. Revolutionary Ideas.

The Declaration is more than a list of complaints against King George. It's a statement of revolutionary political philosophy drawn from Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke. The ideas it expresses will echo through history.

First, it asserts that all people have natural rights that governments cannot legitimately take away. This contradicts the old idea that monarchs rule by divine right. Instead, governments exist to protect people's rights, and their power comes from the consent of the governed.

Second, it declares that when government becomes tyrannical, the people have the right - even the duty - to alter or abolish it and create new government. This justifies revolution as a legitimate political act when circumstances warrant it.

Third, though it says "all men are created equal," the Declaration plants seeds of universal human equality. Over time, groups denied these rights - women, enslaved people, indigenous peoples, workers - will point to these words and demand their own freedom and equality.

Father says the Declaration creates a promise America must strive to fulfill. We've declared these principles, but we don't yet live up to them. The real revolution won't be won just on battlefields - it will be the long struggle to make our practices match our principles.
