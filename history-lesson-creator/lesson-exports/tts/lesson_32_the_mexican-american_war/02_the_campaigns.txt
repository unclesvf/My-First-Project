Chapter 2. The Campaigns.

The war has gone badly for Mexico from the start. General Zachary Taylor captured Monterrey and defeated a larger Mexican force at Buena Vista. General Winfield Scott landed at Veracruz and marched inland toward Mexico City, following the route Cortés took three centuries earlier. Scott is brilliant - he's taken fortress after fortress with minimal American casualties.

The fighting is brutal. At Churubusco, Mexican defenders including the San Patricio Battalion - Irish-American deserters who switched sides - fought to the death rather than surrender. At Chapultepec, teenage Mexican cadets chose to die defending their military academy rather than retreat. One wrapped himself in Mexico's flag and leapt to his death rather than let it be captured. Mexicans fight with desperate courage, but American artillery and discipline prevail.

I was at the Battle of Cerro Gordo, where we flanked the Mexican army and routed them. I saw Mexican soldiers - boys my age - running in terror as American troops advanced with bayonets. Some begged for mercy in Spanish I understood but my commanding officer didn't. The killing felt like murder, not war.

By September 1847, we captured Mexico City. General Scott raised the American flag over the National Palace. Mexico's government collapsed, unable to continue the fight. We've conquered their capital, occupied their country, crushed their army. Victory is complete - and completely unjust.
