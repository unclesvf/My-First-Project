Chapter 3. The Price of Victory.

The war cost about 13,000 American lives - though most died of disease, not battle. Mexican casualties were far higher, including thousands of civilians. We've devastated their country, killed their young men, occupied their capital. And for what? To seize territory Polk wanted from the beginning.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo is being negotiated now. Rumors say Mexico will lose California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming - about 55% of their pre-war territory. The Rio Grande will be the Texas border. America will pay $15 million, which sounds generous until you realize we're paying for land we took by force. It's like a thief offering to buy the wallet he just stole from you.

The treaty promises that Mexicans living in the ceded territories can keep their property and become American citizens if they choose. But I don't trust these promises. I've seen how Americans treat Mexicans. The Spanish land grants will be challenged in American courts. English-only laws will marginalize Spanish speakers. Within a generation, Californios and Tejanos will be foreigners in their own homeland.

My family in New Mexico will become Americans overnight. They're worried. Will they be equal citizens or second-class subjects? Will their Catholic faith be respected? Will their land grants be honored? Will their children speak Spanish or be forced to abandon it? Becoming American doesn't feel like opportunity - it feels like occupation.
