Chapter 4. The Slavery Question Returns.

The war's most dangerous consequence isn't in Mexico - it's in America. We've gained over 500,000 square miles of new territory, and every inch reopens the question: will it be slave or free?

Even before the war ended, Congressman David Wilmot proposed the Wilmot Proviso - banning slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico. The idea inflamed the South. They'd supported the war expecting to expand slavery westward. If new territories are all free, the North will dominate Congress forever. The South threatens secession if slavery is banned from the Mexican Cession.

The North, meanwhile, increasingly opposes slavery's expansion. They see the war itself as a slaveholders' conspiracy to grab more territory for their evil institution. The Free Soil Party forms, dedicated to preventing slavery's spread. Their slogan: "Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, Free Men."

California's gold rush in 1849 makes this urgent. Thousands flood to California, creating a population large enough for statehood almost instantly. But will it be slave or free? The Missouri Compromise doesn't apply - California is too far west. We need a new compromise, and quickly.

I see the future clearly: the land we've taken from Mexico will tear America apart. Every territory we add makes the slavery conflict worse. We couldn't solve the question with the Louisiana Purchase territories. We couldn't solve it with Texas. We won't solve it with California and New Mexico. Eventually, we'll fight each other over the very territories we took from Mexico. The Mexican-American War's real casualty will be American union.
