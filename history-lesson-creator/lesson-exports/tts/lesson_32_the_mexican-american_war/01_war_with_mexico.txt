Chapter 1. War with Mexico.

I'm Miguel, sixteen, a private in the U.S. Army fighting in Mexico. My family is from New Mexico, Spanish-speaking Catholics who've lived here for generations. When Texas joined the Union last year and President Polk sent troops to the disputed border, war became inevitable. Mexico says the border is the Nueces River. America claims it's the Rio Grande, 150 miles south. Polk ordered General Taylor to occupy the disputed zone. When Mexican troops fired on American soldiers, Polk told Congress: "American blood has been shed on American soil." War was declared in May 1846.

Many Americans support this war as Manifest Destiny - God's will for America to expand. Newspaper editor John O'Sullivan writes that we're bringing democracy and progress to backward Mexico. Young men volunteer eagerly, seeing glory and adventure. They sing songs about conquering Mexico City.

But not everyone supports the war. Abolitionists like Frederick Douglass denounce it as a scheme to expand slavery into new territories. Congressman Abraham Lincoln questions Polk's claim about where American blood was shed, demanding to see the exact "spot" where the attack occurred. He suspects Polk provoked the war deliberately. Henry David Thoreau goes to jail rather than pay taxes supporting what he calls an unjust war.

I'm conflicted. I'm American, but my family is culturally Mexican. I fight alongside Anglo soldiers who call Mexicans greasers and talk about their racial inferiority. They say we're bringing civilization to savages. But Mexico City was a great capital when English colonists were starving at Jamestown. Mexican culture is rich, complex, deeply rooted. We're not saving Mexico - we're conquering it.
