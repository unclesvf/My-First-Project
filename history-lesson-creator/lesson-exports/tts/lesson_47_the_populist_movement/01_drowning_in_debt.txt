Chapter 1. Drowning in Debt.

I'm Emma, sixteen years old, and I live on a wheat farm in Kansas. My family works from sunrise to sunset planting, tending, and harvesting wheat. We work harder every year. Yet every year we sink deeper into debt.

The problem isn't laziness. We produce more wheat than ever. But the more we produce, the lower prices fall. In 1870, wheat sold for $1.50 per bushel. Now in 1896, it's 50 cents. We produce three times as much wheat but earn less money.

Meanwhile, our costs keep rising. The railroad monopolies charge whatever they want to ship our crops to market. We have no choice - there's only one railroad through Kansas. They charge us high rates while giving rebates to big corporations.

Banks charge crushing interest rates on loans. We borrowed money to buy equipment and seed. Now we owe more than our farm is worth. If we can't pay, the bank will foreclose - take our land and auction it.

Farm equipment manufacturers, seed companies, grain elevator operators - they all charge high prices because they control the market. We're price-takers, not price-makers. We sell our wheat at whatever price buyers offer and buy supplies at whatever price sellers demand.

Father sits at the kitchen table calculating debts. "We worked all year," he says, "and we're $200 deeper in debt." Mother cries quietly. My younger siblings don't understand why we work so hard yet have so little.

This is the farmers' crisis of the 1890s. We're the backbone of America - we feed the nation - yet we're being crushed by railroads, banks, and corporations. Something has to change.
