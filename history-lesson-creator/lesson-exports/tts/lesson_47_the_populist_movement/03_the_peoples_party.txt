Chapter 3. The People's Party.

In 1892, the Farmers' Alliance forms a political party: the People's Party, also called the Populist Party. At the founding convention in Omaha, Nebraska, we adopt a platform demanding sweeping reforms.

The preamble is radical: "We meet in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral, political, and material ruin. Corruption dominates the ballot-box, the Legislatures, the Congress... The fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few... From the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed the two great classes - tramps and millionaires."

Our platform demands:
• Free and unlimited coinage of silver
• Graduated income tax
• Government ownership of railroads
• Direct election of senators
• Eight-hour workday for industrial workers
• Immigration restriction

We're trying to unite farmers, workers, and reformers against corporate power. We see ourselves as the producing class - people who create wealth through labor - fighting against parasites who profit from our work without contributing.

In 1892, our candidate James Weaver wins over a million votes and 22 electoral votes. In Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and other western states, Populists win governorships and congressional seats. We're a serious political force.

But we face opposition from both major parties. Democrats and Republicans unite to defeat us. Newspapers call us radicals, socialists, and anarchists. Banks and railroads fund campaigns against us. Violence and fraud mar elections.

Still, we're building a movement. For the first time, farmers have a political voice. We're challenging corporate power and demanding that government serve the people, not just the wealthy.
