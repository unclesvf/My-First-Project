Chapter 5. Defeat and Legacy.

November 1896. McKinley wins. He carries the Northeast, Midwest, and urban areas. Bryan carries the South and rural West. The split is clear: cities and industry versus farms and agriculture. Corporate power versus the people.

We're devastated. Father sits silent at dinner. "They outspent us ten to one," he says. "Banks, railroads, corporations - all their money went to McKinley. How can we compete?"

The Populist Party declines after 1896. Some Populists join the Democrats. Others give up on politics. The movement fragments and fades.

But our ideas don't die. Many Populist demands will be achieved in the Progressive Era:

• The graduated income tax (Sixteenth Amendment, 1913)
• Direct election of senators (Seventeenth Amendment, 1913)
• Government regulation of railroads (Interstate Commerce Commission strengthened)
• Labor reforms including the eight-hour day
• Initiative, referendum, and recall in many states

We lost the battle but influenced the war. We showed that farmers and workers could organize politically, that corporate power could be challenged, that government could serve ordinary people rather than just the wealthy.

I'm eighteen now. Our farm survived - barely. We're still in debt, still struggling. But I learned something from the Populist movement: change is possible if people organize and fight for it.

The Populists proved that ordinary Americans could articulate a vision for a more just society and build a political movement to achieve it. We failed to win the presidency, but we changed the conversation. We pushed reforms that major parties eventually adopted. We showed that American democracy could be more than a choice between two corporate-backed parties.

The struggle between concentrated wealth and democracy continues. The Populists showed one path forward: organize the people against the plutocrats. Whether through elections, cooperatives, or direct action, ordinary Americans have power if we use it collectively.

Father says the Populist Party failed, but the Populist spirit survives. Every time farmers organize, workers strike, or citizens demand their government serve the people rather than the powerful - that's the Populist legacy. We didn't win in 1896, but we planted seeds that will keep growing.
