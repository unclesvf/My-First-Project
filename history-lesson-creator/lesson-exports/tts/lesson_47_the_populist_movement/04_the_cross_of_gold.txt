Chapter 4. The Cross of Gold.

1896. The presidential election focuses on the money question: gold standard or free silver?

Republicans nominate William McKinley, who supports the gold standard. He's backed by banks, corporations, and Eastern financial interests. His campaign manager, Mark Hanna, raises millions from wealthy donors.

Democrats are divided. Then William Jennings Bryan, a 36-year-old congressman from Nebraska, gives the most electrifying speech in American political history at the Democratic National Convention.

Bryan's "Cross of Gold" speech defends free silver and attacks the gold standard:

"There are two ideas of government. There are those who believe that if you just legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, that their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it."

He attacks Eastern bankers and defends farmers and workers:

"You come to us and tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard. I tell you that the great cities rest upon these broad and fertile prairies. Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country."

Then his closing, arms outstretched as if crucified:

"You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!"

The convention erupts. Bryan wins the Democratic nomination. The Populist Party also nominates him. We finally have a candidate who speaks for us, who understands our suffering, who will fight the money power.

The campaign is intense. Bryan travels 18,000 miles, gives 600 speeches. McKinley stays home, running a "front porch campaign" funded by corporate millions. We farmers work desperately for Bryan - our last hope.
