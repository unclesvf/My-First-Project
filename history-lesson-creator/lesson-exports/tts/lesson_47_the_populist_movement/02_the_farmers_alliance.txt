Chapter 2. The Farmers' Alliance.

Farmers across the country are organizing. The Farmers' Alliance starts in Texas and spreads across the South and West. By 1890, it has over a million members.

The Alliance holds meetings in schoolhouses and churches. Farmers share their struggles and realize we all face the same problems: falling crop prices, railroad monopolies, high interest rates, lack of political power.

The Alliance tries cooperative solutions. We establish cooperative grain elevators to store crops and avoid middlemen. We create cooperative stores to buy supplies in bulk at lower prices. We negotiate with railroads for better shipping rates.

Some cooperatives succeed, but most fail. Railroads refuse to negotiate. Banks won't lend to cooperatives. Large corporations undercut our prices until we go bankrupt. We realize economic cooperation isn't enough - we need political power.

The Alliance becomes political. We demand reforms:

• Government regulation of railroads and grain elevators
• Graduated income tax so the wealthy pay their fair share
• Direct election of senators (currently state legislatures elect them, and corporations control legislatures)
• Government ownership of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones
• Unlimited coinage of silver to increase the money supply

This last demand - "free silver" - is crucial. The money supply is based on gold. As the economy grows, there's not enough money in circulation. This causes deflation - prices fall, making debts harder to repay. We owe debts in dollars that are worth more each year.

If the government coined unlimited silver, the money supply would increase. This would cause inflation - prices would rise, making debts easier to repay. Creditors oppose this because it reduces the real value of money owed to them. But debtors like us support it desperately.
