Chapter 3. The Abolition Movement.

The most radical reform inspired by the Awakening is abolition - the immediate end to slavery. William Lloyd Garrison publishes The Liberator, demanding emancipation now, without compensation to slaveholders, without colonization to Africa. His motto: "I will be heard!"

This position is far more extreme than earlier antislavery movements. Previously, antislavery meant gradual emancipation, compensating owners, perhaps sending freed people to Africa. Garrisonian abolition is uncompromising: slavery is sin, slaveholders are sinners, compromise with evil is itself evil.

The religious logic is clear: if all people are God's children with souls to be saved, slavery is a moral abomination. How can Christians enslave fellow Christians? How can America claim to value liberty while holding millions in bondage? The contradiction between American ideals and slavery becomes unbearable to revival-fired consciences.

Theodore Weld and the Grimké sisters - Sarah and Angelina - tour the North giving speeches against slavery. The Grimkés are especially powerful because they're Southern, from a slaveholding family, speaking from personal witness of slavery's evils. Their testimony converts thousands to the abolitionist cause.

But abolitionists face violent opposition. Mobs attack their meetings, burn their publications, tar and feather speakers. Even many Northerners view abolitionists as dangerous radicals threatening the Union and inciting slave rebellions. Reform isn't popular - it's divisive, dangerous work.
