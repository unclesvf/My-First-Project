Chapter 4. Women's Growing Role.

The Second Great Awakening empowers women in unexpected ways. Revivals welcome women's participation - they can testify, lead prayer groups, even sometimes preach. This challenges the traditional view that women should be silent in church and submissive at home.

Women dominate reform movements numerically. They organize temperance societies, education campaigns, poorhouse relief, and moral reform associations. They argue that women have special moral authority because of their role as mothers and moral guardians of families.

But public activism creates a dilemma. Women can't vote, can't hold political office, face legal restrictions on property ownership and education. The Grimké sisters, traveling to speak against slavery, are attacked not just for their abolitionism but for speaking publicly at all. Some clergy insist women speaking publicly violates biblical teaching.

This contradiction radicalizes some women reformers. If they can see slavery's injustice, why can't they see women's oppression? If they demand rights for enslaved people, why not demand rights for women? The connection between abolition and women's rights becomes clear: both challenge hierarchy, inequality, the idea that some people are naturally subordinate to others.
