Chapter 2. Perfectionism and Reform.

The Second Great Awakening teaches that people can be perfected through faith. This idea has explosive implications: if individuals can be perfected, why not perfect society? Religious enthusiasm spills into social activism. We call it creating the "Kingdom of God on Earth."

The temperance movement grows directly from revival fervor. Reformers argue alcohol destroys families, causes poverty and crime, prevents spiritual growth. They establish temperance societies, demand pledges of abstinence, push for laws restricting or banning alcohol sales. Mother joined our local temperance society, believing drunkenness is the root of domestic violence and family suffering.

Education reform also emerges. Horace Mann argues all children deserve free public education, not just the wealthy. If democracy requires informed citizens, and salvation requires reading the Bible, then universal education becomes both politically and religiously necessary. New York and Massachusetts lead in establishing public schools.

Dorothea Dix investigates how society treats the mentally ill - she finds them chained in cellars, beaten, neglected. Her religious convictions drive her to demand reform: asylums instead of prisons, treatment instead of punishment, compassion instead of cruelty. She successfully lobbies states to establish mental hospitals.
