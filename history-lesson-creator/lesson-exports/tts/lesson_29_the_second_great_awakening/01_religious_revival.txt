Chapter 1. Religious Revival.

I'm Emily, fifteen, from Rochester, New York - part of what they call the "Burned-Over District" because religious revivals sweep through so often it's like the land has been burned over by spiritual fire. This year, 1831, Charles Finney held a six-month revival here that transformed our town. Thousands attended meetings, hundreds converted.

Finney's message differs from old Puritan theology. Puritans taught predestination - God chose who'd be saved before they were born, and humans couldn't change it. Finney preaches free will - you can choose salvation. You can decide to accept Christ, reform your life, be saved. This is revolutionary: salvation isn't predetermined but chosen.

The camp meetings are unlike anything traditional churches offer. Thousands gather in fields. Preachers shout and gesture dramatically. People cry, faint, speak in tongues. They call it being "slain in the Spirit." The emotional intensity is overwhelming - religion becomes personal, immediate, felt rather than merely believed.

New denominations flourish. Methodists and Baptists grow explosively because they emphasize personal conversion and emotional worship. Traditional churches like Congregationalists decline. Even stranger groups emerge - Mormons founded by Joseph Smith claim new scripture and prophecy. Seventh-Day Adventists predict Christ's imminent return. America's religious landscape is fragmenting and multiplying.
