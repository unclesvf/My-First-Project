Chapter 5. The Reform Legacy.

The Second Great Awakening transforms American society. It makes religion emotional and personal rather than formal and institutional. It empowers individuals to choose their salvation. It sparks hundreds of reform movements aimed at perfecting society.

But it also reveals deep divisions. Reform movements often conflict. Abolitionists split over whether to work within the political system or demand immediate, uncompromising change. Temperance advocates divide over whether to persuade individuals or pass prohibition laws. Women's rights activists clash with those who think women should reform society only within traditional roles.

The Awakening's optimism - that people and society can be perfected - will shape American culture for generations. Americans will believe they can solve any problem, fix any injustice, create heaven on Earth through enough effort and faith. This optimism drives American reform, American imperialism, American exceptionalism.

But the Awakening also intensifies sectional conflict. Northern revivals produce abolitionists. Southern revivals produce defenders of slavery who use the Bible to justify it. Both sides claim religious authority. When North and South finally fight, both will pray to the same God and claim His blessing. The religious energy that inspires reform also fuels the conflict that will tear the nation apart.

Standing in Rochester, watching reform movements multiply, I see America's future being shaped. We're learning that religious conviction can change the world. Whether that change brings freedom or conflict, unity or division, depends on which vision of God's kingdom prevails.
