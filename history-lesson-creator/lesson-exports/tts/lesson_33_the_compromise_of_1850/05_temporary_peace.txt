Chapter 5. Temporary Peace.

The Compromise of 1850 brings temporary calm. Tensions ease. Talk of secession fades. Many Americans are relieved that catastrophe was averted. We've postponed the crisis again, just as the Missouri Compromise postponed it in 1820.

But others see the compromise as a failure. Abolitionists are disgusted that California's admission was purchased with the Fugitive Slave Act. They vow civil disobedience, refusing to obey what they consider an immoral law. Ralph Waldo Emerson declares, "This filthy enactment was made in the nineteenth century, by people who could read and write. I will not obey it, by God."

The South, meanwhile, sees the compromise as a last stand. Many Southerners feel they made huge concessions - admitting California free, ending the D.C. slave trade - in exchange for Northern promises to respect slavery where it exists and enforce the Fugitive Slave Act. If the North doesn't keep its promises, many Southerners say, secession will be justified.

Living in California, far from these tensions, I see the compromise's fundamental flaw: it doesn't resolve anything. It admits California free but doesn't address whether slavery can expand elsewhere. It strengthens fugitive slave laws but doesn't address the moral question of slavery itself. It buys time but doesn't build lasting peace.

Father is pessimistic. "We've patched the hole in the dam," he says, "but water pressure keeps building. The Missouri Compromise bought thirty years. This one might buy ten. Eventually, the dam will break, and when it does, the flood will be catastrophic."

Standing in our California store, free state citizens in a divided nation, I understand we're living in a breathing space between storms. The Compromise of 1850 saved the Union - for now. But it didn't solve the slavery question. It just postponed the day of reckoning. That day is coming, and when it arrives, compromise won't be enough. The slavery question will be answered not through congressional deals but through blood and fire. The Compromise of 1850 is America's last peaceful attempt to manage the unmanageable. Its failure will lead to war.
