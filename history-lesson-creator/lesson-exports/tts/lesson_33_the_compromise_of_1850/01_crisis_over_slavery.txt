Chapter 1. Crisis Over Slavery.

I'm Anna, fifteen, living in San Francisco. The California Gold Rush has transformed our territory overnight. In 1848, when gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, California had maybe 14,000 non-Native residents. By 1850, we have over 100,000. We've written a constitution, established government, and applied for statehood.

But there's a problem: our constitution bans slavery. We want to enter the Union as a free state. This would destroy the delicate balance in the Senate. Currently there are fifteen slave states and fifteen free states, giving each side equal representation. Admitting California free would give free states a 16-15 advantage. The South is threatening secession if we're admitted.

Father owns a general store serving miners. He explains the crisis: "The South fears that if free states dominate the Senate, they'll eventually abolish slavery everywhere. They see California's admission as an existential threat. Some Southern congressmen are openly discussing leaving the Union rather than accepting permanent minority status."

The whole nation is on edge. John Calhoun, the South's intellectual leader, is dying but still fighting for Southern rights. He warns that the North's opposition to slavery's expansion will destroy the Union. William Seward of New York argues that there's a "higher law than the Constitution" that demands freedom - infuriating Southerners who believe Northerners are abandoning constitutional compromises.
