Chapter 2. Clay's Compromise.

Henry Clay, now 73 and in failing health, proposes one last compromise to save the Union. He's brokered compromises before - the Missouri Compromise in 1820, the Tariff Compromise in 1833. He's called the "Great Compromiser," though critics say he just postpones inevitable conflicts.

Clay's proposal has multiple parts: First, admit California as a free state - what we desperately want. Second, organize Utah and New Mexico territories without deciding on slavery, letting settlers eventually decide through "popular sovereignty." Third, end the slave trade (but not slavery itself) in Washington D.C., where it embarrasses the nation. Fourth, pass a stricter Fugitive Slave Law requiring Northerners to help capture runaway slaves. Fifth, resolve Texas's boundary disputes and assume its debts.

It's classic Clay - something for everyone, something to anger everyone. California gets statehood as a free state, pleasing the North. The South gets the Fugitive Slave Act and the possibility of slavery in Utah and New Mexico through popular sovereignty. Both sides have to swallow things they hate.

The debates are epic. Clay speaks for hours defending his compromise. Calhoun, too weak to speak, has his speech read arguing that the North must stop opposing slavery or the Union will dissolve. Daniel Webster, Massachusetts senator and Northern icon, shocks abolitionists by supporting the compromise, including the Fugitive Slave Act. He's called a traitor by anti-slavery Northerners, but he believes saving the Union matters more than opposing slavery's expansion.
