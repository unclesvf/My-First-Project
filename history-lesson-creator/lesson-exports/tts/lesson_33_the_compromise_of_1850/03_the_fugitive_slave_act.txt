Chapter 3. The Fugitive Slave Act.

After months of debate, the Compromise passes in September 1850. California is admitted as the thirty-first state, a free state! We celebrate in San Francisco with parades, speeches, and fireworks. We're Americans now, full members of the Union.

But our celebration is muted by the Fugitive Slave Act, the compromise's most controversial provision. This law requires federal marshals to arrest suspected runaways. It denies accused runaways jury trials - a commissioner decides their fate, earning $10 if he rules the person is a slave but only $5 if he rules them free, creating a financial incentive for slave-catchers. Any citizen who refuses to help capture runaways can be fined $1,000. The law applies nationwide, making the entire country complicit in slavery.

Northern states are outraged. Some pass "Personal Liberty Laws" trying to protect accused runaways, though these conflict with federal law. Vigilance committees form in Northern cities to warn fugitives when slave-catchers arrive and help them escape to Canada. Churches openly defy the law, hiding runaways in their basements.

The law terrorizes free Black communities in the North. Slave-catchers can seize any Black person, claim they're a runaway, and haul them before a biased commissioner with minimal evidence. Free people who've lived in the North for years are kidnapped and sold South. Parents warn children never to talk to strangers, never to go out alone. The North's free Black population lives in fear.
