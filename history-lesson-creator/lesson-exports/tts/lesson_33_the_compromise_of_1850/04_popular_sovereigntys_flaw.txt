Chapter 4. Popular Sovereignty's Flaw.

The compromise's popular sovereignty provision sounds democratic - let settlers decide slavery for themselves. But it's morally bankrupt. Whether human beings can be enslaved shouldn't be decided by majority vote. And it invites conflict, as we'll see when Kansas and Nebraska territories are organized.

Stephen Douglas, the Illinois senator who championed popular sovereignty, argues it's the perfect solution: it's democratic, respects local self-government, and removes slavery from national politics. Let each territory decide for itself, he says, and the nation can avoid tearing itself apart over the issue.

But this assumes slavery is just another political question, like tariff rates or internal improvements. It's not. It's about whether human beings can be property, whether liberty is a fundamental right or a privilege reserved for whites. You can't compromise on that through voting.

The compromise also exposes the hypocrisy of Manifest Destiny rhetoric. We claimed to bring freedom and democracy to Mexican territories. Now we're organizing those same territories with the possibility of slavery. We conquered Mexico in freedom's name, then prepared to extend slavery into the conquered lands. The inconsistency is staggering.
