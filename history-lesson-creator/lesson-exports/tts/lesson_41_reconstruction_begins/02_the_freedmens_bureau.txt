Chapter 2. The Freedmen's Bureau.

Days after emancipation, most formerly enslaved people are still on the plantations. Some leave immediately, seeking family members sold away or just wanting to experience freedom by traveling. But most stay, not because we want to but because we have nowhere else to go.

The Union army establishes the Freedmen's Bureau - an agency to help formerly enslaved people transition to freedom. Bureau agents arrive in Georgia, setting up offices in towns.

I walk to town with my mother to visit the Bureau office. The agent is a young Union officer from Massachusetts. He's sympathetic but overwhelmed. Thousands of freed people need help - food, shelter, land, work, education. The Bureau has limited resources.

"We're providing rations for those who have no food," he explains. "We're setting up schools so you can learn to read and write. And we're helping negotiate labor contracts with landowners."

Labor contracts. The agent explains that freed people can work for former slaveholders, but now as paid laborers with written contracts. The contracts specify wages, working conditions, and term of employment. Both parties must agree. If the landowner violates the contract, the Bureau will intervene.

It sounds better than slavery. But when Mother and I return to the plantation, Master Harrison offers a contract that pays almost nothing - $5 a month plus rations and a cabin. We'd work dawn to dusk, just like before, with harsh penalties for "idleness" or "disobedience."

Mother refuses to sign. "I won't work for him anymore," she says. "Not for any wage."

We leave the plantation with nothing but our clothes. We walk to town, where the Freedmen's Bureau provides temporary shelter and rations. They help Mother find work as a laundress. It doesn't pay much, but she's her own boss now. That matters more than money.

The Freedmen's Bureau also sets up a school. I enroll immediately. Learning to read feels like true freedom - access to knowledge formerly forbidden to enslaved people.
