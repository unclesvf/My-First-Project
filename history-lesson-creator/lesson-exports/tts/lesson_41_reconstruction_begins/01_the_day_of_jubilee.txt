Chapter 1. The Day of Jubilee.

I'm Marcus, fifteen years old, and I was born enslaved on a cotton plantation in Georgia. I've worked in the fields since I was seven - planting, weeding, picking cotton from dawn to dusk. I've been whipped for working too slowly. I've watched my older sister sold away when I was ten. I've lived every day knowing I was property, not a person.

June 1865. The war is over. Union soldiers arrive at our plantation. They gather all the enslaved people - about 200 of us. A Union officer reads from a paper: By order of the President of the United States, all persons held as slaves are declared free.

Free. The word doesn't seem real. We've heard rumors for months - Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, Confederate surrender, the Thirteenth Amendment working its way through the states. But hearing it officially declared, by a Union officer with the power to enforce it, makes it real.

Some people shout and cry. Others are silent, stunned. Old Samuel, who's been enslaved for sixty years, falls to his knees weeping. My mother grabs my hand, squeezing so hard it hurts. "We're free, Marcus," she whispers. "Free."

Master Harrison watches from the porch, face red with anger. He shouts that we're still his property, that the Union has no right to steal his slaves. The Union officer ignores him. "You're free to go wherever you want," he tells us. "You don't have to stay here."

But where would we go? We have no money. No land. No possessions except the clothes we're wearing. We don't know where our families who were sold away have gone. Freedom is wonderful in principle, but terrifying in practice. What do we do now?
