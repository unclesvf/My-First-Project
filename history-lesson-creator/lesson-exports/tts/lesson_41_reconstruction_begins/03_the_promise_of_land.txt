Chapter 3. The Promise of Land.

Summer 1865. There are rumors spreading through freed communities: "Forty acres and a mule." The government will give freed people land confiscated from Confederate plantations.

The rumor comes from General Sherman's Special Field Order No. 15, issued in January 1865. It set aside land along the South Carolina and Georgia coast for formerly enslaved families. Each family could claim forty acres. The army would loan mules.

By June, 40,000 freed people have settled on 400,000 acres of this land. They're building homes, planting crops, creating communities. For the first time, they own the land they work.

I meet a family who'd settled on one of the Sea Islands. "It's ours," the father tells me, eyes shining. "We own forty acres. Our children will inherit it. We're free and we're landowners."

But then President Johnson reverses the policy. He pardons former Confederates and returns their land - including the land freed people have settled on. Federal troops force families off land they've been farming for months.

The devastation is total. Freed people believed the government had promised them land. "Forty acres and a mule" seemed like acknowledgment that we'd earned ownership through centuries of unpaid labor. Taking it away feels like a betrayal.

Most freed people have no choice but to work for former slaveholders. But without land of our own, we have no leverage. Landowners offer terrible wages or sharecropping arrangements. Sharecropping means we work the land for a share of the crop - typically half. The landowner provides land, tools, and seed. We provide labor.

In theory, sharecropping could work. In practice, it becomes a system of debt peonage. Landowners charge high prices for supplies, keep unfair records of debts, and manipulate the final accounting so sharecroppers end up owing money each year. We're trapped in cycles of debt, unable to leave until we pay what we "owe."

Freedom without land or education or capital isn't much freedom. It's survival, not prosperity.
