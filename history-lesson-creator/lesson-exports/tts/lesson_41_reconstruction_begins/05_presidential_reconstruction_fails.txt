Chapter 5. Presidential Reconstruction Fails.

By late 1865, it's clear that President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policy has failed. Johnson pardoned most former Confederates, allowed them to vote and hold office, and did nothing to stop the Black Codes. He opposes federal intervention to protect freed people's rights.

Johnson believes Reconstruction should be lenient and quick. Restore Southern states to the Union, let them govern themselves, move on. He opposes Black voting rights, saying states should decide that question. His racism is barely concealed - he openly says he believes white people are superior and Black people unfit for citizenship.

Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress grow increasingly angry. They'd fought a war to end slavery and preserve the Union. Now former Confederate leaders were returning to Congress, Black Codes were re-establishing quasi-slavery, and freed people had no protection.

In December 1865, Congress refuses to seat the Southern representatives and senators Johnson allowed to be elected. Congress forms the Joint Committee on Reconstruction to investigate conditions in the South.

The committee hears testimony from freed people about Black Codes, violence, exploitation, and denial of rights. They hear about the Ku Klux Klan - a terrorist organization of former Confederates who attack, whip, and murder freed people and white Republicans to maintain white supremacy.

Congress decides to take control of Reconstruction away from Johnson. They'll pass laws protecting freed people's rights, require Southern states to guarantee Black voting rights, and use federal military power to enforce these requirements.

It's called "Radical Reconstruction," though it's only radical in insisting that freed people actually be free and have rights as citizens. To us, it's just common sense - freedom means political rights, legal equality, and protection from violence. Anything less isn't freedom at all.

I'm sixteen now, watching as Congress and the President battle over Reconstruction. The outcome will determine whether the promise of emancipation - freedom, citizenship, equality - will be fulfilled or betrayed. Radical Reconstruction offers hope. But I've learned that hope must be fought for, defended, and never taken for granted. The struggle for real freedom has only just begun.
