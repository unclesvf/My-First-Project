Chapter 4. The Black Codes.

Fall 1865. Southern states begin passing "Black Codes" - laws specifically targeting freed people and restricting our freedom.

Georgia's Black Code requires freed people to have written proof of employment. If you don't have a contract with a landowner, you can be arrested for vagrancy and forced to work for whoever pays your fine. It's slavery by another name.

The codes prohibit Black people from owning firearms, serving on juries, testifying against white people in court, or voting. They establish separate legal standards - harsher punishments for Black people than whites for the same crimes.

Some codes even require freed people to get licenses to work in any job other than farmer or servant. The licenses are expensive, keeping us in agricultural labor controlled by white landowners.

I experience the Black Codes personally. Walking through town one evening, I'm stopped by a white constable. "Where's your proof of employment?" he demands.

I explain I'm enrolled in the Freedmen's Bureau school and living with my mother, who works as a laundress. He says that's not good enough. I need a labor contract with a landowner or I'm vagrant. He arrests me.

At the courthouse, they fine me $10 - two months' wages for most freed people. I can't pay. The judge says I'll be hired out to whoever pays the fine. A plantation owner pays it. Now I owe him $10 plus interest, to be worked off at $5 per month. I'm trapped in forced labor.

The Freedmen's Bureau agent intervenes, arguing the arrest was illegal. After weeks of bureaucracy, they release me. But thousands of other freed people aren't so lucky. They're trapped in labor arrangements that differ from slavery only in name.

The Black Codes prove that former slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers still control Southern state governments. They're using legal mechanisms to restore as much of the pre-war social order as possible. Freedom guaranteed by the Thirteenth Amendment means little when state laws can criminalize Black life itself.
