Chapter 2. Survival and Struggle.

The first months were the hardest. We planted crops, but the soil was different here, and many plants withered in the unforgiving sun. Fish from the nearby waters kept us alive when our Spanish provisions ran low.

I learned to respect the Timucua. They showed us which plants were safe to eat, how to track animals through the palmetto scrub, and where to find fresh water. Without them, I don't think we would have survived.

But tension simmered beneath our fragile peace. Some Spanish soldiers treated the Timucua poorly, demanding food and labor. Father argued with the garrison commander about this, saying we would never truly settle here if we made enemies of those who knew the land.

I befriended a Timucua boy named Ahone, who was about my age. He taught me words in his language, and I taught him Spanish. We would meet by the river when we could, away from the suspicious eyes of both our peoples.
