Chapter 5. Victory Incomplete.

The celebration is joyful but also bittersweet. We've won a crucial victory, but equality is far from achieved.

First, many Black women still can't vote. The Nineteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination "on account of sex," but Southern states use the same Jim Crow tactics against Black women that they use against Black men: poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, violence, and intimidation. Black women fought for suffrage too - leaders like Mary Church Terrell and Ida B. Wells worked for both women's rights and civil rights. But they won't fully exercise voting rights until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

Second, Native American women can't vote because Native Americans aren't citizens. That won't change until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.

Third, in some states, poll taxes prevent poor women of all races from voting. These won't be abolished until the Twenty-Fourth Amendment in 1964.

Fourth, winning the vote doesn't mean winning equality. Women still face discrimination in employment, education, property rights, and family law. We can't serve on juries in many states. We're paid less than men for the same work. Professions like law and medicine remain largely closed to us. Married women often can't own property or sign contracts without their husbands' permission.

The suffrage movement itself had significant flaws. Many white suffragists excluded or marginalized Black women. Some used racist arguments, claiming educated white women deserved the vote more than "ignorant" Black men. The movement prioritized gender over race, sometimes collaborating with racist politicians to gain support.

Mother and I talk about this. "The vote is a tool," she says, "not the goal. The goal is full equality - economic, legal, social. We've won the tool. Now we use it to achieve the goal."

I'm sixteen, part of the first generation of American women growing up with the right to vote. I won't take it for granted. I'll vote in every election. I'll use my voice in politics. I'll fight for the further reforms needed to achieve genuine equality.

The suffragists taught me that change requires sustained struggle. They fought for 72 years. Some dedicated their entire lives to a cause they didn't live to see succeed. They believed in a principle - that women are equal citizens entitled to equal rights - and they fought for it despite obstacles.

That principle still requires fighting for. Winning the vote is a milestone, not the destination. Our daughters and granddaughters will continue the work we're starting. Each generation moves closer to genuine equality. The suffragists showed us it's possible. Now it's our turn to continue the fight.
