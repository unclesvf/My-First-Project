Chapter 2. Two Strategies - NAWSA and the NWP.

By the early 1900s, the suffrage movement split into two organizations with different strategies.

The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), led by Carrie Chapman Catt, pursued a state-by-state strategy. They lobbied state legislatures to grant women voting rights, believing success at the state level would build momentum for a federal amendment. Wyoming granted women's suffrage in 1869, followed by Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and eventually fifteen states by 1914.

NAWSA's approach was moderate and patient. They emphasized that women voters would support reforms like prohibition, child labor laws, and political corruption. They avoided confrontation, worked within the system, and sought to prove women were responsible enough for political participation.

Alice Paul took a different approach. She founded the National Woman's Party (NWP) in 1916. Paul had participated in the British suffrage movement, where women used militant tactics - hunger strikes, property destruction, public protests.

Paul brought those tactics to America. In January 1917, the NWP began picketing the White House - the first group ever to do so. Women called "Silent Sentinels" stood outside the White House holding signs: "Mr. President, How Long Must Women Wait for Liberty?" and "Democracy Should Begin at Home."

When America entered World War I in April 1917, the picketers continued, which outraged many Americans. How could women protest during wartime? The picketers carried signs quoting President Wilson's own words about democracy and self-determination, asking why those principles didn't apply to American women.

Police arrested over 200 picketers for "obstructing traffic." In prison, they were beaten, confined to filthy cells, and force-fed when they went on hunger strikes. Paul herself was force-fed, a brutal procedure where guards held her down and pushed a tube down her throat to pour liquid food into her stomach.

The brutality backfired. Public sympathy turned toward the suffragists. Women who endured imprisonment and force-feeding for the right to vote seemed heroic, not radical.
