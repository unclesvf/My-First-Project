Chapter 3. The Final Push - Wilson Changes His Mind.

President Woodrow Wilson initially opposed women's suffrage, saying it was a state issue, not a federal one. But the combination of NAWSA's lobbying, the NWP's protests, and women's contributions to the war effort changed his mind.

During World War I, women took jobs in factories, served as nurses, sold war bonds, and managed farms while men fought overseas. They proved they could handle responsibilities traditionally reserved for men. The war demonstrated that women were full participants in American society who deserved full citizenship rights.

In January 1918, Wilson announced his support for a federal suffrage amendment. He called it a "war measure" necessary for morale and credibility. How could America claim to fight for democracy abroad while denying it to half its citizens at home?

The House of Representatives passed the amendment in January 1918 by exactly the two-thirds majority required. The Senate was harder. Suffragists lobbied intensely. Finally, in June 1919, the Senate passed the amendment.

Then came ratification - thirty-six states (three-fourths of the forty-eight states) needed to approve it. Suffragists organized in every state. Anti-suffragists fought back, arguing women's suffrage would destroy families, lead to moral decay, and give Black women the vote (a racist argument used especially in the South).

The ratification battle went state by state. By August 1920, thirty-five states had ratified. Tennessee was the final state needed. The Tennessee legislature was evenly divided. One young legislator, Harry Burn, planned to vote against ratification. But his mother sent him a letter: "Be a good boy... and vote for suffrage." He switched his vote. Tennessee ratified by one vote.

On August 26, 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment became law: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."
