Chapter 1. Seneca Falls to Susan B. Anthony.

I'm Alice, sixteen years old, and today - August 26, 1920 - I watched my mother vote for the first time in her life. The Nineteenth Amendment has been ratified. Women have won the right to vote after 72 years of struggle.

The fight began at Seneca Falls, New York in 1848. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized the first women's rights convention. Three hundred people attended. They issued the Declaration of Sentiments, modeled on the Declaration of Independence:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal."

The declaration listed grievances: women couldn't vote, couldn't own property after marriage, couldn't attend college, couldn't enter most professions, had no legal rights to their own children. The convention demanded women's suffrage - the right to vote.

Many supporters of women's rights thought demanding the vote was too radical. Even some women's rights advocates believed women weren't ready for political participation. But Stanton and others insisted voting rights were fundamental to equality.

Susan B. Anthony joined the movement in 1851. She and Stanton became partners, traveling the country giving speeches, organizing conventions, petitioning legislatures. They faced ridicule, rotten eggs thrown at speeches, newspapers calling them unwomanly and dangerous.

In 1872, Anthony voted illegally in Rochester, New York to test whether the Fourteenth Amendment (which made "all persons born or naturalized in the United States" citizens) gave women the right to vote. She was arrested, tried, and fined. The judge wouldn't let her testify in her own defense because she was a woman. She refused to pay the fine.

Anthony and Stanton spent decades fighting for a federal suffrage amendment. They died without seeing victory - Stanton in 1902, Anthony in 1906. But they built a movement that would eventually succeed.
