Chapter 4. The First Vote.

November 2, 1920. The first presidential election where women can vote nationwide. Mother and I go to the polling place together. She's forty-five years old and voting for the first time.

The polling place is crowded. Men who've voted their whole lives stand in line alongside women voting for the first time. Some men are supportive. Others grumble about women in politics. A few make rude comments. Mother ignores them.

When it's Mother's turn, the poll worker hands her a ballot. Her hands shake slightly. She's waited her entire adult life for this moment. She marks her ballot carefully, then drops it in the box.

"I voted," she says, tears in her eyes. "I actually voted."

Later, at home, we talk about the suffragists who made this possible. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who demanded the vote when it seemed impossible. Susan B. Anthony, who fought for fifty years and died before victory. Carrie Chapman Catt, whose state-by-state strategy built the foundation. Alice Paul, whose militant tactics forced action.

Millions of women - whose names aren't remembered - who attended meetings, signed petitions, gave speeches, marched in parades, endured ridicule and sometimes violence. Women who believed in a principle and fought for it across generations.

Mother tells me about her mother - my grandmother - who attended suffrage meetings in the 1890s. Grandmother died in 1915, five years before victory. "She would have been so happy to see this," Mother says.

The suffrage movement proves that change is possible even when it seems impossible. For 72 years, from Seneca Falls to the Nineteenth Amendment, women fought against entrenched opposition. They faced arguments that women were too emotional, too delicate, too ignorant for politics. They faced laws that treated them as property, not citizens. They endured arrest, imprisonment, and force-feeding.

But they persisted. And they won.
