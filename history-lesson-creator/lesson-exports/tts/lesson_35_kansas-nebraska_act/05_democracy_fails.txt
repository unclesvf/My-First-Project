Chapter 5. Democracy Fails.

Kansas eventually joined the Union as a free state in 1861 - but only after the Southern states had already seceded. By then, the lesson of Kansas was clear: the slavery question couldn't be solved through popular sovereignty, compromise, or peaceful politics.

Looking back, I understand what went wrong. Popular sovereignty sounded democratic, but it failed because both sides refused to accept outcomes they opposed. Pro-slavery forces rigged elections. Free-state settlers formed their own government. Neither side trusted democratic processes when they might lose.

Democracy requires shared values and willingness to accept majority rule. We didn't have that in Kansas. We had two incompatible visions: one where slavery was an accepted institution, another where it was an intolerable evil. There was no middle ground.

Stephen Douglas thought popular sovereignty would take the slavery issue out of Congress and let local people decide. Instead, it brought the conflict to Kansas and turned it into a war zone. Rather than solving the slavery question, popular sovereignty showed it was unsolvable through peaceful means.

I'm twenty-one now. Kansas is finally at peace, admitted as a free state. But the nation isn't at peace. The same conflict that bled Kansas is tearing the country apart. Southern states are seceding. War is coming.

I think about those years of violence - the raids, the murders, the fear. I think about John Brown, hanged in 1859 for raiding the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, trying to start a slave rebellion. I think about Senator Sumner, beaten unconscious for a speech. I think about neighbors killing neighbors over an institution that should never have existed.

Bleeding Kansas was a preview of the Civil War. We showed that Americans would kill each other over slavery. We showed that political solutions had failed. We showed that when fundamental moral questions divide a people, words give way to violence.

The experiment of popular sovereignty failed in Kansas. And with its failure, the nation's last hope for peaceful resolution of the slavery question died too. We're all Kansas now - bleeding and divided, heading toward a war that might have been avoided if we'd faced the truth earlier: slavery was wrong, and no compromise could make it right.
