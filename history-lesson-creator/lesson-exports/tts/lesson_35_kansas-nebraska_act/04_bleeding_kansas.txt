Chapter 4. Bleeding Kansas.

The violence didn't stop. For the next three years, Kansas bled.

Pro-slavery "Border Ruffians" and free-state "Jayhawkers" raided each other's settlements. They burned homes, stole livestock, destroyed crops. They murdered people suspected of supporting the other side. No one was safe.

My family's farm was raided twice. The first time, Border Ruffians stole our horses and warned Father to leave Kansas or face consequences. The second time, they burned our barn. We rebuilt, but we slept with rifles beside our beds.

Other families had it worse. The Wilkinson family - free-staters - were driven from their home and fled to Iowa. The Jones family - pro-slavery - had their son killed in an ambush. Neighbors who'd once helped each other now feared each other.

Some settlers gave up and left. Kansas's population fluctuated as people fled the violence. But others, like my family, stayed. We believed Kansas must be free, and we wouldn't let intimidation drive us away.

John Brown became a legendary figure - hero to some, terrorist to others. He led raids against pro-slavery settlements, always claiming God's will justified his actions. His methods were brutal, but his conviction was absolute.

Federal troops were sent to keep peace, but they mostly sided with the pro-slavery territorial government, viewing free-staters as rebels. We appealed to Washington for fair elections, federal intervention, admission as a free state. We were ignored.

By 1858, over 200 people had died in Bleeding Kansas. The phrase became a rallying cry for both sides: abolitionists pointed to Kansas as proof that slavery couldn't be contained peacefully; Southerners pointed to Kansas as proof that abolitionists were violent radicals.

The nation watched Kansas bleed and saw its own future.
