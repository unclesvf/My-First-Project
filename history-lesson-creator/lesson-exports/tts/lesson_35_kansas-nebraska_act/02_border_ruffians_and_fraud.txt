Chapter 2. Border Ruffians and Fraud.

The 1855 territorial election should have been straightforward: Kansas settlers vote on whether to allow slavery. Instead, it became a farce.

Days before the election, thousands of armed Missourians - called "Border Ruffians" - crossed into Kansas. They weren't settlers. They came just to vote illegally, then returned to Missouri. They carried weapons, whiskey, and determination to make Kansas a slave state.

I was in Lawrence on election day. Armed men surrounded polling places. They threatened anyone who challenged their right to vote. When election judges asked for proof of residency, the Border Ruffians showed them guns instead of documents.

"Are you going to question my ballot?" one Missourian asked our poll judge, hand on his revolver. The judge backed down.

The results were absurd. Precincts with a hundred residents recorded six hundred votes. Some areas reported more votes cast than the entire population of Kansas Territory. The pro-slavery candidates won overwhelmingly - through massive fraud.

A pro-slavery territorial legislature was installed. They immediately passed laws protecting slavery, making it illegal to speak against slavery, and requiring an oath of loyalty to the pro-slavery government to hold office or vote. Free-state settlers refused to recognize this fraudulent government.

We formed our own free-state government in Topeka, elected our own legislature, wrote our own constitution banning slavery. Now Kansas had two competing governments, each claiming legitimacy. Federal authorities backed the pro-slavery legislature. We backed the free-state government.

It was absurd - and dangerous. Two governments couldn't occupy the same territory. Something had to give.
