Chapter 3. Violence Erupts.

May 1856. Pro-slavery forces attacked Lawrence, the free-state capital. They called us traitors and rebels. They said they'd teach us to respect the lawful government.

Eight hundred armed men marched on Lawrence. They destroyed our printing presses - the Herald of Freedom and the Kansas Free State - throwing the type into the river. They burned the Free State Hotel, a symbol of anti-slavery resistance. They looted homes and businesses. They fired a cannon at Governor Robinson's house.

No one was killed in the attack, but the "Sack of Lawrence" enraged free-state settlers. We'd been peaceful, believing democracy and law would prevail. The attack showed that pro-slavery forces would use violence to get their way.

Three days later, John Brown responded. I didn't know Brown well - he was a fierce abolitionist with burning eyes and absolute certainty. He had come to Kansas with his sons to fight slavery.

Brown and his followers went to Pottawatomie Creek, where pro-slavery settlers lived. In the middle of the night, they dragged five men from their homes and killed them with broadswords. The victims weren't Border Ruffians or attackers of Lawrence - they were settlers who supported slavery. Brown called it divine justice. Others called it murder.

I was horrified. Violence had begotten violence. Both sides now had blood on their hands. The cycle of revenge had begun, and I didn't see how it could stop.

The violence in Kansas was matched by violence in Washington. Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts gave a speech condemning the "Crime Against Kansas." Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina, enraged by the speech, walked into the Senate chamber and beat Sumner nearly to death with a cane. Sumner was so badly injured he couldn't return to the Senate for three years.

Popular sovereignty had failed spectacularly. Instead of peaceful democracy, we had guerrilla warfare.
