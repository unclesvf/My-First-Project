Chapter 3. Jackson's Response.

President Jackson's reaction shocked us. Jackson is a Southerner, a states' rights advocate, a slave owner. We expected sympathy. Instead, he responded with fury.

Jackson issued a Proclamation to South Carolina: nullification is incompatible with the Constitution. No state can refuse to enforce federal law. "Disunion by armed force is treason," he declared. He threatened to personally lead an army to South Carolina to enforce federal law. He requested and received from Congress a "Force Bill" authorizing military action.

Jackson's position is clear: he supports states' rights within the constitutional framework, but nullification goes too far. It threatens the Union itself. He'll tolerate many things, but not disunion. "Our Federal Union - it must be preserved," he toasted pointedly at a dinner, staring at Calhoun.

The crisis escalated. South Carolina threatened to secede if Jackson used force. Jackson threatened to hang Calhoun for treason. We stockpiled weapons and drilled militia. The federal government prepared for war. The Union stood on a knife's edge - one wrong move, and we'd be in civil war thirty years before it actually happened.
