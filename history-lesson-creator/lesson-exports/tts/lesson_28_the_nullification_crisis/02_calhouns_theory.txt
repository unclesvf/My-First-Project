Chapter 2. Calhoun's Theory.

Father explains Calhoun's logic: the Constitution is a compact among sovereign states. The states created the federal government and delegated it certain limited powers. When the federal government exceeds those powers, states have the right to judge and resist.

Calhoun argues that the tariff isn't a legitimate revenue measure - it's designed to protect one section's industry at another section's expense. This violates the compact. Therefore, states can nullify unconstitutional federal laws.

This sounds principled, but I see the deeper issue. Our South Carolina economy depends on slavery. We fear that if the federal government can impose tariffs against our will today, it might abolish slavery tomorrow. Nullification is about protecting slavery as much as protesting tariffs.

The theory has dangerous implications. If every state can nullify laws it dislikes, what holds the Union together? What stops complete fragmentation? If South Carolina can nullify tariffs, can Massachusetts nullify fugitive slave laws? Can any state reject any federal law by claiming it's unconstitutional? Calhoun's theory logically leads to disunion.
