Chapter 1. The Tariff Crisis.

I'm James, sixteen, from South Carolina. Our state is in uproar over what we call the "Tariff of Abominations." This high protective tariff helps Northern manufacturers by making imported goods expensive, forcing Americans to buy Northern-made products. But we don't manufacture - we grow cotton.

The tariff devastates our economy. We sell cotton on the world market at world prices, but we must buy manufactured goods at inflated prices because of the tariff. Northern factories profit while Southern farmers suffer. Father says it's sectional tyranny - the North using its congressional majority to enrich itself at the South's expense.

Vice President John C. Calhoun - a South Carolina man - developed a theory called nullification. He argues that states, as sovereign entities that created the federal government, can declare federal laws unconstitutional and refuse to enforce them within their borders. If the federal government oversteps its constitutional authority, states have the right to resist.

South Carolina's legislature adopted an Ordinance of Nullification, declaring the tariff null and void within our state. We won't collect it, won't enforce it. The question now echoes through the nation: can states reject federal laws? Or does federal law reign supreme? Our answer will determine whether we stay one nation or fracture into pieces.
