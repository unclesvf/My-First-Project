Chapter 4. Clay's Compromise.

Henry Clay, the "Great Compromiser," found a way out. He proposed gradually reducing the tariff over ten years while simultaneously passing Jackson's Force Bill. South Carolina could claim victory - the tariff would be lowered. Jackson could claim victory - federal supremacy was maintained. Both sides could back down without losing face.

The Compromise Tariff passed. South Carolina repealed its Nullification Ordinance. But in a final act of defiance, we "nullified" the Force Bill - asserting the principle even while accepting the compromise. It was symbolic, but symbols matter.

The crisis ended, but the fundamental questions remained unanswered. Does federal law trump state law absolutely? Can states resist federal power they consider tyrannical? What happens when majority rule tramples minority rights? We postponed these questions, didn't resolve them.

Father said the crisis taught us that we won't get our way through legal channels. "If Northern majority can impose tariffs against our will, they can impose anything. Abolition could be next. When that happens, we'll secede rather than submit." The nullification crisis was a warning: the South would fight - politically, legally, and if necessary militarily - to protect its interests, meaning slavery.
