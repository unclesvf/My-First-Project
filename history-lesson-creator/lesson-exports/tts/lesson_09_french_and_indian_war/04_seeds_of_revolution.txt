Chapter 4. Seeds of Revolution.

The war changed everything, though we didn't see it at first. Britain had huge war debts and thought the colonies should help pay them - after all, the war had been fought partly for our benefit. They planned to station 10,000 troops in America and expected us to help pay for them through new taxes.

King George III issued a Proclamation in 1763 forbidding colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains. This enraged settlers like me who'd fought for that land. We'd risked our lives to secure the Ohio Valley, and now Britain told us we couldn't live there. It was meant to prevent conflicts with Native tribes, but we saw it as betrayal.

The war also changed how we saw ourselves. Colonial militias had fought alongside British regulars. Sometimes we'd been treated with contempt, called inferior soldiers. But we'd proven ourselves in battle. We'd developed confidence in our own abilities and resentment of British arrogance.

Most importantly, the war removed the French threat. For decades, we colonials had needed British military protection against France. Now that France was gone, we felt less dependent on Britain. Within twelve years of this great victory, we'd be at war with Britain itself. The seeds of revolution were planted in the very soil of our triumph.
