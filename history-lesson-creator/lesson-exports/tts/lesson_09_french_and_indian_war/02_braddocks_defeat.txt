Chapter 2. Braddock's Defeat.

The next year, the British sent General Edward Braddock with two regiments of professional soldiers. They were going to capture Fort Duquesne, the French stronghold where Pittsburgh stands today. I marched with them, part of the colonial militia supporting the British regulars.

Braddock was confident, even arrogant. He commanded European-style warfare - soldiers in bright red coats marching in formation, drums beating. Washington and other colonials warned him that this style wouldn't work in American forests. Braddock ignored them, calling us provincials who knew nothing of proper warfare.

On July 9, 1755, we were ambushed near the Monongahela River. French soldiers and their Native allies attacked from behind trees and rocks. Our British regulars, trained to fight in open fields, stood in formation and were cut down. The red coats made perfect targets. Officers on horseback were shot first. Chaos erupted.

I survived by diving behind a fallen log and firing at movement in the trees. General Braddock was mortally wounded. Young Washington had horses shot out from under him but survived. Out of 1,300 men, nearly 1,000 were killed or wounded. We retreated in disaster. I learned that pride comes before a fall - and that the French and Indians were formidable enemies.
