Chapter 3. The Tide Turns.

For several years, the war went badly for Britain. The French won victory after victory. Their Native allies raided frontier settlements, and colonists fled east for safety. I wondered if we would lose everything we'd built.

But in 1758, William Pitt became Britain's leader and changed strategy. He poured money and troops into America, making this theater of war a priority. He promoted talented officers and worked with colonials instead of dismissing us. The tide began to turn.

Fort Duquesne fell. Louisburg fell. The French were being pushed back. Then came the decisive moment: in 1759, British General James Wolfe led an army up the cliffs to Quebec City. Both Wolfe and the French commander Montcalm were killed, but the British won. Quebec fell, and with it, French power in North America crumbled.

By 1763, the Treaty of Paris ended the war. France gave Canada and all land east of the Mississippi to Britain. Spain got Louisiana from France as compensation for losses. The British Empire now dominated North America. We colonials celebrated - we'd helped win a great victory. We had no idea how this triumph would soon lead to our own rebellion.
