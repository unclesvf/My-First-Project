Chapter 1. Clash of Empires.

My name is Benjamin, and I am sixteen years old. I joined the Virginia militia last spring, following a young officer named George Washington into the wilderness beyond the Allegheny Mountains. We were sent to protect Virginia's claim to the Ohio River Valley - land that both England and France claim as their own.

The French have been building forts throughout the region, connecting Canada to Louisiana. They trade with the Native peoples and have many allies among the tribes. We English colonists want this land for settlement and farming. The stage was set for conflict.

In May, we engaged a small French force near a place called Great Meadows. It was my first battle - confusing, terrifying, loud. We won that skirmish, but it was hardly a victory. We killed a French diplomat, which the French say was murder. Young Washington built a crude fort he called Fort Necessity.

A month later, a massive French and Indian force surrounded us. We were outnumbered three to one. After a day of fighting in the rain, Washington surrendered. They let us march home, but I understood something important: the French and their Native allies knew this land far better than we did. This war would not be easy.
