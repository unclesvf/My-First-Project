Chapter 5. The Other Side.

I'm older now, twenty-five, with scars from battles and memories that haunt me. Time has given me perspective I lacked as a young militiaman. We celebrated Britain's victory, but I've come to understand what we rarely acknowledged: this was someone else's loss, someone else's catastrophe.

The Native peoples fought alongside France because they understood what we colonists represented - an endless wave of settlers pushing westward, clearing forests, claiming hunting grounds, driving them from ancestral lands. The French had been traders, willing to coexist. We English wanted the land itself, wanted to own it, farm it, transform it. For the tribes, our victory meant their doom.

After the war, I met a Shawnee man named Red Hawk at a trading post. His people had fought against us. "You won your war," he told me, "but you've started another you don't yet understand. We will not simply disappear." His words proved prophetic - Pontiac's Rebellion erupted the year the war ended, as tribes rose up against British expansion.

I think about the French habitants in Canada, now living under British rule, their world turned upside down. I think about the Spanish in Louisiana, suddenly under French control then Spanish again as empires traded territories like merchant goods. And I think about us colonials, victorious but soon to be taxed and restricted, our reward for winning becoming the reason we'd rebel.

The French and Indian War taught me that every victory contains the seeds of future conflict. We fought for land, for empire, for glory. But in winning, we set forces in motion that would transform everything - creating an American identity separate from Britain, pushing Native peoples toward their long resistance, and lighting the fuse of revolution. Sometimes I wonder if anyone truly wins such wars, or if we all just trade one set of problems for another.
