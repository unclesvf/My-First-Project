Chapter 1. Separating from the Church.

My name is Elizabeth, and I am twelve years old. My family are Separatists - we broke away from the Church of England because we believe it is corrupt. In England, this belief made us criminals. We could be jailed, fined, or worse for refusing to attend the official church.

For years, we lived in Holland, where we could worship freely. But Holland felt foreign to us. My parents worried we were losing our English ways and that I might grow up more Dutch than English. So when the Virginia Company offered us a chance to settle in America, we decided to go.

Not all of us were Separatists - we called ourselves "Saints," and we called the others "Strangers." The Strangers came for land and opportunity, not religious freedom. This caused tension aboard our ship, the Mayflower, as we crossed the Atlantic Ocean.

The voyage was terrible. For sixty-six days, we were crammed below deck in a dark, damp space. The ship pitched and rolled. People were seasick constantly. Two people died during the crossing, but one baby was born - they named him Oceanus because he was born at sea.
