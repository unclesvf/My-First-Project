Chapter 4. Help from Squanto.

In March, an amazing thing happened. A Native American man walked into our settlement and greeted us in English! His name was Samoset, and he brought us to meet Massasoit, the leader of the Wampanoag people.

Massasoit brought with him a man named Squanto, whose story was heartbreaking. Squanto had been kidnapped by English traders years before, taken to Europe, and eventually made his way back home - only to find his entire village wiped out by disease. He was the last of his people.

Despite everything the English had done to him, Squanto chose to help us. He taught us how to plant corn using fish as fertilizer. He showed us where to find clams and eels. He taught us which plants were safe to eat and how to tap maple trees for syrup. Without his help, we would have died that second year.

We made a peace treaty with Massasoit that lasted over fifty years. In autumn of 1621, after our first successful harvest, we held a feast to celebrate. Massasoit and ninety of his men joined us for three days of eating and thanksgiving. This feast became the memory we now call the First Thanksgiving, though we didn't call it that then.
