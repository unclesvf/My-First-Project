Chapter 5. A New Beginning.

I am eighteen now, and Plymouth is a real town. We have sturdy houses, productive fields, and enough food stored for winter. More ships bring new settlers each year. We're no longer desperately clinging to survival - we're building a permanent community.

Father says the Mayflower Compact was our colony's most important achievement. Not the houses we built or the crops we grew, but that agreement to govern ourselves by common consent. It proved that people could create their own government without a king commanding them. Other colonies have noticed, and some have followed our example.

Yet I cannot forget the price we paid. Mother's grave is in our hillside cemetery along with fifty others from that first winter. Squanto died four years ago from fever, still helping us negotiate with other tribes. His grave is here too. Sometimes I wonder if we had the right to take this land, even with Massasoit's blessing.

The Wampanoag helped us survive, but already I see English settlements pushing further inland, taking more land. Our children will inherit a world where we English grow stronger and the native peoples grow weaker. I pray this won't end in bloodshed, but I fear my prayers may go unanswered. We came seeking freedom to worship as we chose, and we found it. But what freedom have we taken from others? These questions haunt me even as I give thanks for our survival.
