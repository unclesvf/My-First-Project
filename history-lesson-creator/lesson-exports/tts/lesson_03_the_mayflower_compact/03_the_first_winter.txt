Chapter 3. The First Winter.

We arrived in November, far too late to plant crops. We had to build shelter before winter's full fury struck. The men worked desperately to construct a common house and a few small homes, but progress was slow in the cold.

That first winter was our starving time. We had little food and inadequate shelter. A terrible sickness swept through us - probably a combination of scurvy, pneumonia, and typhus. People died almost every day. By spring, half of our 102 passengers were dead, including my mother.

I helped care for the sick, though I was just a child. I watched Father and the other survivors dig graves in the frozen ground. We buried our dead secretly at night so the native people wouldn't know how weak we'd become. We feared they might attack if they knew half of us had perished.

Only four or five women survived that winter. My aunt became like a mother to me. We lived in constant fear and grief, wondering if we'd made a terrible mistake in coming to this harsh land. Many times I wished we'd stayed in Holland, even if it meant not being fully English.
