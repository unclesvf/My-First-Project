Chapter 2. The Mayflower Compact.

When we finally sighted land, we faced an immediate problem: we were far north of Virginia, outside the Virginia Company's territory. This meant we had no legal government. Some of the Strangers said they would do as they pleased since no laws bound them here.

Our leaders knew this could lead to chaos. So before we even left the ship, forty-one men (including my father) gathered in the Mayflower's cabin. They wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact, agreeing to form a government and obey its laws for the good of the colony.

The Compact stated that we would create "just and equal laws" for the general good. It wasn't complete democracy - women and servants couldn't sign it - but it was a remarkable agreement. We were creating our own government by consent of the governed, not by order of a king.

William Bradford became our governor. He would lead us through the darkest times ahead and write the history of our colony. The Compact became the foundation of Plymouth Colony's government and an important precedent for self-government in America.
