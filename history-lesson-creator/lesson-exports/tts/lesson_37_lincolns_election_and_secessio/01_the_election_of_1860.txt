Chapter 1. The Election of 1860.

I'm William, fifteen years old, from Charleston, South Carolina. The presidential election of 1860 has our city in turmoil. Father says this election will determine whether we remain in the Union or leave it.

The election is complicated. Four major candidates are running. The Democratic Party split along sectional lines. Northern Democrats nominated Stephen Douglas, supporting popular sovereignty. Southern Democrats nominated John Breckinridge, demanding federal protection of slavery in all territories.

The Constitutional Union Party, trying to avoid the slavery issue entirely, nominated John Bell. They call for preserving the Union without taking sides on slavery.

And then there's Abraham Lincoln, the Republican candidate. Republicans oppose slavery's expansion into the territories, though they promise not to interfere with slavery where it already exists. Their platform says slavery is morally wrong and must be contained.

No Republican has ever won the presidency. Their party didn't even exist six years ago. And they're not even on the ballot in most Southern states, including South Carolina. We can't vote for Lincoln even if we wanted to - which we don't.

Father and his friends talk constantly about what they'll do if Lincoln wins. "A Black Republican president," they call him, though Lincoln isn't actually radical on slavery. He just opposes its expansion. But to Southerners, that's enough. Father says Lincoln's election would be a declaration that the North has permanent control of the government and will slowly strangle slavery to death.

"We won't submit to rule by a sectional Northern party," Father says. "If Lincoln wins, South Carolina will secede from the Union."

I'm not sure what to think. All my life I've been taught that South Carolina is part of the United States. I've learned about Washington and Jefferson, the Constitution and the Union. Now Father says we'll leave? It's frightening and exciting at once.
