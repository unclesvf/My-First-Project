Chapter 3. The Confederacy Forms.

South Carolina's secession triggers a chain reaction. Within weeks, six more states of the Deep South follow: Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. All cite Lincoln's election and Northern hostility to slavery as reasons for leaving.

In February 1861, delegates from the seceded states meet in Montgomery, Alabama. They form a new nation: the Confederate States of America. They write a constitution - similar to the U.S. Constitution but explicitly protecting slavery. They elect Jefferson Davis of Mississippi as president and Alexander Stephens of Georgia as vice president.

Stephens gives a speech explaining the Confederacy's foundation. He says the United States was founded on the false idea "that all men are created equal." The Confederacy, he says, is founded on the opposite principle: "that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition."

I'm at the dinner table when Father reads Stephens's speech from the newspaper. He nods approvingly. "Finally, someone speaking the truth," he says.

I feel uncomfortable but don't say anything. Mother, who's never liked slavery much but accepts it, looks troubled. My older sister Sarah asks, "But Father, isn't slavery wrong? Reverend Thompson has preached that all souls are equal before God."

Father's face hardens. "Reverend Thompson is a fool if he said that. The Bible supports slavery. Ham's descendants were cursed to servitude. Slavery is ordained by God and nature."

The conversation ends. But Sarah's question stays with me. I've grown up in a slaveholding society. Our family owns three enslaved people who work our farm and household. I've never questioned it before. But now, as we create a new nation explicitly founded on slavery, I wonder if we're on the right side.

Eight slave states remain in the Union: Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. They're waiting to see what happens. If Lincoln uses force against the Confederacy, they'll likely secede too. If he accepts Confederate independence peacefully, they'll likely stay.

Everything depends on what happens next.
