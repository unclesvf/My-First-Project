Chapter 1. A Merchant's Life.

My name is James, and I am fifteen years old. My father is a captain of a merchant ship that sails the Atlantic trade routes. I've been on three voyages with him, learning the merchant's trade and keeping the ship's ledgers.

Our ship is part of what people call the "triangular trade" - though it's not always a perfect triangle. We carry goods between the American colonies, the Caribbean, Africa, and England. Each leg of the journey carries different cargo, and each port brings profit.

Father owns a share of the ship with two other Boston merchants. They invest in the cargo we carry: rum, lumber, dried fish, iron goods. The profits from these voyages have made our family wealthy. We live in a fine brick house on the harbor, and I'll inherit the business one day.

But I've learned that not all trade is honorable. Some of our fellow merchants participate in the slave trade - the most profitable and most terrible branch of Atlantic commerce. Father refuses to carry human cargo, but he trades with those who do. I'm beginning to understand that in this interconnected world of trade, no one's hands are entirely clean.
