Chapter 5. Breaking the Chain.

I've made a decision that Father doesn't fully understand. When I inherit the business, I will not trade in goods produced by enslaved labor. No sugar, no tobacco, no rice, no indigo. I know this will cost us profit - these are the most valuable commodities in Atlantic trade.

Father says I'm being impractical, that one merchant's conscience won't change the system. "You'll just make yourself poor while others grow rich," he warns. Perhaps he's right. But I've seen too much to continue participating, even indirectly, in human misery.

I've been reading pamphlets by Quaker abolitionists who argue that slavery violates Christian principles and natural rights. If all men are created equal, as they say, then slavery is an abomination. The economic argument - that colonies need slavery to prosper - is a lie we tell ourselves to avoid confronting moral truth.

I'm young, and my protest is small. But I believe the triangular trade's days are numbered. The contradiction is too great - English colonists who fled oppression now oppress others; Christians who preach love practice cruelty; merchants who prize liberty deny it to hundreds of thousands. Something will have to give. I don't know when or how, but I believe future generations will look back on this system with horror and shame. I want to be able to say I stood against it, even when standing against it cost me.
