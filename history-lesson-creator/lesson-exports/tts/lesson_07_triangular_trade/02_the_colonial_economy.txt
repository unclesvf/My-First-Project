Chapter 2. The Colonial Economy.

The thirteen colonies produce different goods based on their climate and resources. New England, where we live, has rocky soil but excellent harbors. We build ships, catch fish, and produce rum from West Indian molasses. We're merchants and craftsmen more than farmers.

The Middle Colonies - New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey - are the "bread basket." They export wheat, flour, and grain to the Caribbean islands and southern Europe. Their fertile soil and moderate climate make them ideal for farming.

The Southern colonies grow cash crops for export: tobacco in Virginia and Maryland, rice in the Carolinas. These labor-intensive crops rely increasingly on enslaved African workers. The plantation owners grow rich, but at a terrible human cost.

The Caribbean islands grow sugar - the most profitable crop in the Atlantic world. Sugar production is brutal work done by enslaved Africans who die in shocking numbers from exhaustion, disease, and abuse. Yet the demand for sugar in Europe seems endless, driving the whole vicious system.
