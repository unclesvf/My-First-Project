Chapter 3. Navigation Acts and Mercantilism.

England controls colonial trade through the Navigation Acts. These laws say we can only trade certain goods with England or other English colonies. We must use English ships with English crews. Valuable goods like tobacco and sugar must go to England first, even if they're destined for other countries.

This is part of mercantilism - the idea that colonies exist to enrich the mother country. We're supposed to provide raw materials to England and buy manufactured goods from them. We're not supposed to manufacture our own finished products or trade freely with other nations.

Many colonists resent these restrictions. Father says the Navigation Acts cost us money - we could get better prices selling directly to France or Spain. Some merchants turn to smuggling, secretly trading with the French Caribbean islands or hiding cargo from English customs officials.

But Father obeys the law, even when it costs us profit. "We're still Englishmen," he says. "These trade routes have made us prosperous, even with their restrictions. Someday, these rules may change. Until then, we work within them." I wonder if he's right, or if the conflict between colonial economic interests and English control will grow worse.
