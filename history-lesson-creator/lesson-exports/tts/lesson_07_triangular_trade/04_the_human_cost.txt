Chapter 4. The Human Cost.

Last year, we were in port in Charleston when a slave ship arrived from Africa. I watched from the dock as the enslaved people were brought up from the hold - thin, sick, traumatized. The smell was unbearable. Many had died during the Middle Passage, their bodies thrown overboard like cargo.

The survivors were sold at auction. Families were separated. Children torn from mothers. People sold to different plantation owners, never to see each other again. The auctioneer spoke of them like livestock, examining their teeth and muscles, pricing them based on their ability to work.

That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the sugar in our tea, the tobacco we ship, the molasses we buy to make rum. Our prosperity - all of colonial prosperity - is built on this system. The triangle connects us all: European manufactured goods, African lives, American resources, Caribbean sugar.

Father says some Quakers in Philadelphia are speaking out against slavery, calling it evil and unchristian. But their voices are few. Most people find slavery too profitable to question. I fear that we're building an economy that will require a terrible reckoning someday. The human cost of our prosperity is too high, but we've built our whole world upon it.
