Chapter 4. Ratification and the Bill of Rights.

The Constitution is finished - creating three branches of government with checks and balances, federalism dividing power between national and state governments. But it needs ratification by nine of thirteen states.

Federalists like Hamilton, Madison, and Jay support it, writing essays called The Federalist Papers. Anti-Federalists like Patrick Henry oppose it, saying it gives too much power to the central government and lacks protection for individual rights.

The debate is intense. To win ratification, Federalists promise to add a Bill of Rights - amendments protecting freedoms like speech, religion, press, and trial by jury. States ratify the Constitution. In 1789, George Washington becomes our first President. The Bill of Rights is added in 1791.

We've created something remarkable: a republic based on popular sovereignty, where government power comes from the people. It's not perfect - it allows slavery, excludes women and non-property owners from voting. But it's a start, and the amendment process means we can improve it over time.
