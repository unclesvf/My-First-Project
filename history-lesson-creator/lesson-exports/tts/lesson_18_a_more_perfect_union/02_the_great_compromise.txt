Chapter 2. The Great Compromise.

Father comes home exhausted each night, unable to tell me details - they've sworn secrecy. But I overhear conversations. The big debate is representation: Should each state have equal votes, or should larger states have more power based on population?

Delegates are deadlocked. Small states fear being controlled by large states. Large states say equal votes are unfair when they have more people. Finally, Roger Sherman proposes the Great Compromise: a two-house legislature. The Senate gives each state equal votes (two senators). The House of Representatives bases votes on population. Both houses must approve laws.

Other compromises follow. Northern and Southern states disagree about counting enslaved people for representation. They settle on the Three-Fifths Compromise - enslaved people count as three-fifths of a person for population purposes. This is morally wrong, but it's the compromise that keeps Southern states in the Union.
