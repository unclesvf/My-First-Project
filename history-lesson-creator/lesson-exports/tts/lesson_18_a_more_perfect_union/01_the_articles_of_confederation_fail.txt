Chapter 1. The Articles of Confederation Fail.

I'm Rebecca, fifteen, living in Philadelphia. My father is a delegate to a special convention meeting here. After winning independence, our states created the Articles of Confederation - a weak central government that's failing. Congress can't collect taxes, regulate trade, or enforce laws. States act like separate countries, printing their own money and ignoring Congress.

Last year, farmers in Massachusetts rebelled against high taxes in Shays' Rebellion. The weak national government couldn't stop it. Everyone realized we need a stronger government, or our new nation will fall apart. That's why delegates from twelve states are meeting in secret at Independence Hall.
