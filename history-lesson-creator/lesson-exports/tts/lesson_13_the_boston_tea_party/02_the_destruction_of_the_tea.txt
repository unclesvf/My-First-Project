Chapter 2. The Destruction of the Tea.

Outside the meeting house, I see men disguising themselves as Mohawk Indians - a thin disguise of blankets, face paint, and feathers. It's meant to hide our identities and perhaps to symbolize that we're Americans, not British. I join them. My heart races with excitement and fear.

We march to Griffin's Wharf where the ships are docked. There are about 150 of us. We board the ships in organized groups. The captains and crew don't resist - this is between us and the British government, not them.

For three hours, we work systematically. We break open 342 chests of tea with axes and hatchets. We dump the tea into Boston Harbor. The smell of tea fills the air. We damage nothing else - this is a protest against the tax, not theft or vandalism. When we're done, we sweep the decks clean.

The next morning, Boston Harbor is a giant tea pot. The destroyed tea is worth £10,000 - a fortune. We've made our point: we will not accept taxation without representation, not even for cheap tea. Britain will have to respond, and I fear what that response will be.
