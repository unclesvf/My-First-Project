Chapter 4. Colonial Unity Emerges.

In September 1774, representatives from twelve colonies (all except Georgia) met in Philadelphia for the First Continental Congress. This was extraordinary - never before had the colonies united like this. Each colony had always looked after its own interests. But now we realized that an attack on one colony was an attack on all.

The Congress debated how to respond to British tyranny. Some wanted immediate armed resistance. Others hoped for reconciliation with Britain. They settled on a middle course: a complete boycott of British goods until the Intolerable Acts were repealed, and a declaration of colonial rights.

They also formed the Continental Association to enforce the boycott. Committees of Correspondence spread throughout the colonies, sharing information and coordinating resistance. We were no longer thirteen separate colonies - we were becoming a united American people.

My master attended meetings of Boston's Committee of Correspondence. He came home energized by the sense of possibility. "For the first time," he said, "we're acting as one. If Britain tries to divide us, they'll fail. We're stronger together than they realize." The Tea Party had achieved more than destroying tea - it had united us in common cause.
