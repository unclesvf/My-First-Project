Chapter 3. The Intolerable Acts.

Britain's response is swift and harsh. Parliament passes laws we call the Intolerable Acts. The Boston Port Act closes Boston Harbor until we pay for the tea - shutting down our economy. The Massachusetts Government Act strips away our charter and self-government. British officials accused of crimes will be tried in Britain, not here. We must quarter soldiers in our homes if needed.

These laws aren't just punishing Boston - they're attacking the fundamental rights of all Massachusetts colonists. Britain is showing its power, trying to make an example of us to frighten other colonies into submission.

But the Intolerable Acts backfire. Instead of isolating Boston, they unite the colonies. The other colonies send food and supplies to help us survive the blockade. They see that what Britain does to Massachusetts, it could do to any colony. Our resistance has become their resistance.

Plans are being made for a Continental Congress - representatives from all thirteen colonies meeting to coordinate a response to British tyranny. The Boston Tea Party wasn't just about tea. It was about whether we would submit to British authority or stand up for our rights. We chose to stand up, and now there's no turning back.
