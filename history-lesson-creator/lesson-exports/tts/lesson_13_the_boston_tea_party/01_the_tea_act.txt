Chapter 1. The Tea Act.

My name is Thomas, and I am fifteen years old. I work as an apprentice carpenter in Boston, but tonight I'm about to become part of history. Parliament has passed the Tea Act, giving the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies. This will drive colonial tea merchants out of business and force us to buy British tea - with a tax attached.

Many colonists see this as a trick. Britain is trying to get us to accept Parliamentary taxation by making the tea cheap. If we buy the taxed tea, we're admitting Parliament has the right to tax us. "It's the principle," my master says. "Once we accept one tax, they'll tax everything."

Three ships carrying East India Company tea have arrived in Boston Harbor: the Dartmouth, the Eleanor, and the Beaver. Governor Hutchinson won't let them leave without unloading their cargo. Samuel Adams and the Sons of Liberty won't let the tea be unloaded. We're at a standoff.

Tonight, December 16, 1773, a huge crowd has gathered at Old South Meeting House. I'm here with my master, listening to speeches about liberty and tyranny. Samuel Adams says, "This meeting can do nothing more to save the country." It's a signal. We all know what happens next.
