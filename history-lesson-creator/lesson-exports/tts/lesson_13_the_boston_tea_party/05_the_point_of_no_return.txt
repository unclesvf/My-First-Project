Chapter 5. The Point of No Return.

Looking back now, I see that December night in 1773 as the point of no return. We'd protested before - boycotts, petitions, demonstrations. But dumping the tea was different. We'd destroyed British property worth a fortune. We'd directly defied British authority. There was no way to undo it, no way to apologize our way out of it.

Britain had to respond with force, or lose all authority over the colonies. The Intolerable Acts weren't a mistake or an overreaction - they were inevitable. And our unified resistance to those acts was equally inevitable. We'd crossed a line from protest to open defiance.

I remember the excitement I felt that night, breaking open the tea chests. I felt like I was striking a blow for liberty. But in the months that followed, as Boston suffered under the blockade, as tensions mounted, as we prepared for possible war, I came to understand what that blow would cost.

My master says we're on a path to independence now, though few dare speak the word aloud. We've discovered that we can stand together against Britain. We've learned that we value our rights more than we value peace. And we've proven we're willing to fight for those rights. The tea floating in Boston Harbor was a symbol - a symbol that we would rather destroy our relationship with Britain than submit to tyranny. Within two years, we'd be at war. The Tea Party was the spark that lit the fuse.
