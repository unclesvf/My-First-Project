Chapter 5. The Power of Resistance.

These years have taught me something profound: ordinary people have power when they stand together. I'm just a printer's apprentice, but when I refuse to buy British tea, when Master Green prints pamphlets explaining our rights, when my neighbors boycott imported goods - we're all part of something larger.

Women have become crucial to this resistance. They're called the "Daughters of Liberty," and they organize spinning bees to produce homemade cloth. They serve coffee instead of tea. They teach their children about liberty and rights. My mother says she feels like she's part of history, not just watching it happen.

The colonial assemblies have grown bolder too. The Massachusetts Assembly circulated a letter to other colonies urging united resistance. Britain ordered them to rescind it. They refused. Britain dissolved the assembly, but that only made more people angry. You can't suppress ideas by silencing the people who speak them - the ideas just spread wider.

I've learned that we're not just fighting about taxes. We're fighting about what it means to have rights. Are we British subjects with the rights of Englishmen? Or are we second-class colonials who must submit to whatever Parliament decides? The answer to that question will shape our future - and Britain's too.
