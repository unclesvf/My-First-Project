Chapter 1. The Stamp Act.

My name is William, and I am sixteen years old. I'm an apprentice at a printing shop in Boston, learning the trade from Master Green. Today, March 22, 1765, news arrived that has everyone in our shop furious: Parliament has passed the Stamp Act.

This law requires colonists to buy special stamped paper for all printed materials - newspapers, legal documents, licenses, even playing cards. Every document must bear a tax stamp purchased from British officials. The money will pay for British troops stationed in America.

Master Green is livid. "This will destroy our business!" he says. We'll have to buy expensive stamped paper for every newspaper, pamphlet, and broadside we print. The cost will drive customers away. But it's not just about money - it's about principle.

"We are British subjects," Master Green declares. "We have the right to be taxed only by our own representatives. We have no representatives in Parliament. Therefore, Parliament has no right to tax us directly. This is tyranny!" His words echo what I'm hearing in taverns, on street corners, everywhere. The cry goes up: "No taxation without representation!"
