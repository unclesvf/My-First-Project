Chapter 4. The Townshend Acts.

Our celebration didn't last long. In 1767, Parliament passed new taxes called the Townshend Acts, named for Charles Townshend, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. These taxes are different from the Stamp Act - they're duties on imported goods like tea, glass, lead, paint, and paper.

Parliament thinks they're being clever. They claim these aren't "internal" taxes like the Stamp Act, but "external" taxes on trade - something they've always regulated. But we see through this distinction. A tax is a tax, and we still have no representation in Parliament.

The revenue from these taxes will pay the salaries of royal governors and judges in America. Master Green explains why this is dangerous: "If Britain pays our governors, they'll serve British interests, not ours. Our governors will no longer depend on colonial assemblies for their salaries, so they won't have to listen to us."

The acts also allow British customs officials to use "writs of assistance" - general search warrants that let them search any building for smuggled goods without specific cause. It feels like our rights as Englishmen are being stripped away, one by one. We renewed our boycotts, and once again, the streets filled with tension.
