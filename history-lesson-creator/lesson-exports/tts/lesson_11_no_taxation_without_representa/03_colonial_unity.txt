Chapter 3. Colonial Unity.

In October, representatives from nine colonies met in New York for a Stamp Act Congress. This is remarkable - the colonies rarely cooperate. But this threat has brought us together. The Congress declared that only colonial assemblies, not Parliament, have the right to tax colonists.

Meanwhile, merchants organized boycotts of British goods. "Non-importation agreements," they call them. Women formed spinning groups to make homemade cloth instead of buying British textiles. Even ordinary people like me are part of this resistance by choosing what we buy.

The boycotts hurt British merchants, who pressured Parliament to repeal the Stamp Act. In March 1766, Parliament repealed it! Church bells rang, celebrations erupted in the streets. We won! Our unity and resistance forced Britain to back down.

But there's a darker side to this victory. Parliament also passed the Declaratory Act, asserting their right to legislate for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever." They may have repealed this tax, but they claim absolute authority over us. The fundamental conflict hasn't been resolved - it's only been postponed.
