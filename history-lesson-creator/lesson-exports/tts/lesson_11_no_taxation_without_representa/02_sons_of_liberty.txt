Chapter 2. Sons of Liberty.

A group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty has formed to resist the Stamp Act. They meet at night, make plans, and intimidate anyone who supports the tax. Their leader is Samuel Adams, a firebrand who writes passionate articles against British tyranny.

I watched yesterday as a mob gathered around the house of Andrew Oliver, the man appointed to distribute stamps in Massachusetts. They hung an effigy of him from a tree, then burned it. They destroyed a building he owned and damaged his house. Oliver resigned the next day, refusing to distribute the stamps.

The crowds frightened me - there's something dangerous about mob violence, even when directed at unjust laws. But I also feel the excitement. We're standing up for our rights. We're refusing to submit to taxation without consent.

Similar protests are erupting throughout the colonies. In New York, stamp distributors resign. In Virginia, Patrick Henry delivers a fiery speech declaring "If this be treason, make the most of it!" The colonies are uniting in resistance, connected by shared outrage at this violation of their rights.
