Chapter 4. No Turning Back.

Tonight, I'm home, exhausted and shaken. I fired my musket at British soldiers today. British soldiers fired at me. Some of my neighbors are dead. This morning we were British subjects arguing about taxes and rights. Tonight we're rebels fighting for our freedom.

News of Lexington and Concord is spreading throughout the colonies. Militias are forming everywhere. Men are marching toward Boston, surrounding the British forces there. The Second Continental Congress will meet to decide what to do. But in truth, the decision has already been made - not in Philadelphia, but here in Massachusetts.

We don't yet call it a revolution. We say we're defending our rights as Englishmen. But we're not fools. We've fired on the King's troops. They've fired on us. There's no peaceful resolution now. We're at war.

Ralph Waldo Emerson would later call that first shot at Concord "the shot heard round the world." He's right. What happened here will echo far beyond Massachusetts. We've shown that ordinary people can stand up to the most powerful empire on Earth. Others will follow our example. The American Revolution has begun, and the world will never be the same.
