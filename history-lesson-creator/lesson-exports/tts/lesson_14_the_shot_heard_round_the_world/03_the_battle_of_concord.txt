Chapter 3. The Battle of Concord.

By the time the British reached Concord, we'd assembled hundreds of militiamen. We watched from a ridge as British soldiers searched the town for weapons and supplies. We'd hidden most of it, but they found some and started burning it. Smoke rose from the town center.

We couldn't just watch our town burn. We marched toward the North Bridge. British soldiers guarded it. Major John Buttrick gave the order: "Fire, fellow soldiers, for God's sake, fire!" We fired. The British fired back. Two militiamen fell dead, but several British soldiers also went down. The British retreated.

This was different from Lexington. We stood our ground. We fought back. We won. The British realized they were in trouble - surrounded by armed colonists who knew every hill, every stone wall, every hiding place in this countryside.

The British began their retreat to Boston. That's when the real fighting began. We didn't fight like European armies in neat lines. We fired from behind trees, stone walls, buildings. All the way back to Boston, we harassed them. They called it cowardly. We called it smart. By day's end, 73 British soldiers were dead, 200 wounded or missing. We lost 49 killed, 39 wounded. The war had begun.
