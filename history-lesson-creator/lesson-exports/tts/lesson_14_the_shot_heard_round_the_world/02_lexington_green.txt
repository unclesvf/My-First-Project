Chapter 2. Lexington Green.

At dawn in Lexington, Captain John Parker lined up about 70 militiamen on the town green. They could hear the British approaching - marching feet, rattling equipment, officers shouting commands. The British force was ten times their size.

Parker told his men: "Stand your ground. Don't fire unless fired upon. But if they mean to have a war, let it begin here." These words echo in my mind as I hear the story later. What courage to stand against the British army!

The British commander, Major Pitcairn, ordered the militiamen to disperse. Parker's men began to withdraw - they couldn't fight such overwhelming numbers. Then a shot rang out. Nobody knows who fired it - British or colonist. It didn't matter. More shots followed. British soldiers fired volleys into the militia.

Eight colonists died on Lexington Green. Ten were wounded. Only one British soldier was slightly injured. It wasn't a battle - it was a slaughter. The British marched on to Concord, thinking they'd crushed colonial resistance. They were wrong.
