Chapter 1. The Midnight Ride.

My name is Nathan, and I am seventeen years old. I'm a Minuteman - part of our militia trained to be ready at a minute's notice. Tonight, April 18, 1775, that training will be tested.

Word has reached us that British troops are marching from Boston to seize our weapons and gunpowder stored in Concord, and possibly to arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock who are hiding in Lexington. We've been preparing for this. The Sons of Liberty have a warning system - lanterns in the Old North Church steeple. "One if by land, two if by sea."

Paul Revere and William Dawes have ridden through the night warning us: "The Regulars are out!" They're coming. At dawn, British soldiers - about 700 of them - will reach Lexington, then Concord. We're outnumbered, but this is our land, our liberty. We will make a stand.

I've grabbed my musket, my powder horn, and my shot pouch. My mother holds back tears as I kiss her goodbye. My father grips my shoulder. "Remember, you're fighting for our rights, for our future," he says. I head to the Concord town green where militiamen are gathering. We're farmers, blacksmiths, shopkeepers - ordinary men about to make history.
