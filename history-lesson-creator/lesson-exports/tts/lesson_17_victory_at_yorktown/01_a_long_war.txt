Chapter 1. A Long War.

I'm Marcus, sixteen years old. My father is a freed Black man fighting for American independence in exchange for his freedom. For six years, this war has dragged on. We've won some battles, lost others. The British control the South. Many Americans are tired, wondering if we'll ever win.

But General Washington has a plan. British General Cornwallis has moved his army to Yorktown, Virginia, on the Chesapeake Bay. He expects British ships to supply and support him. Washington sees an opportunity - if we can trap Cornwallis with the French fleet blocking the bay, we might win a decisive victory.
