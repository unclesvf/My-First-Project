Chapter 4. Surrender.

On October 19, 1781, Cornwallis surrenders. Over 7,000 British soldiers lay down their weapons. As they march out, their band plays "The World Turned Upside Down" - an appropriate song. We colonists have defeated the mighty British Empire.

I watch with my father as redcoats stack their muskets. Some British soldiers are crying. American and French soldiers stand at attention. Washington sits on his horse, dignified in victory. My father stands straight and proud - a free man who helped win freedom for a nation.

This doesn't end the war officially - that will take two more years of negotiations. But Yorktown is the decisive victory. Britain will give up. We've won. The United States of America will be independent.
