Chapter 3. The Siege.

The siege of Yorktown lasts three weeks, and every day brings us closer to victory. Our artillery - American and French cannons positioned in carefully dug trenches - pounds the British positions day and night. The sound is constant, thunderous. I help carry ammunition, my ears ringing from the noise.

Washington and Rochambeau coordinate their forces with precision. We dig parallel trenches, each one closer to British fortifications. This is siege warfare - slow, methodical, deadly. British artillery fires back, and men die every day, but we keep advancing.

On October 14, Father participates in a night assault on British Redoubt Number 10. American troops, including Black soldiers like him, charge with bayonets fixed, taking the position in brutal hand-to-hand combat. The French simultaneously capture Redoubt Number 9. With these positions in American hands, our artillery can fire directly into Yorktown.

Cornwallis is desperate. He tries to evacuate across the York River to Gloucester Point, hoping to escape north. But a sudden storm scatters his boats. Even nature seems to favor American independence. By October 17, Cornwallis sends a drummer boy and an officer with a white flag. He's ready to discuss terms. After six years of war, the end is finally in sight.
