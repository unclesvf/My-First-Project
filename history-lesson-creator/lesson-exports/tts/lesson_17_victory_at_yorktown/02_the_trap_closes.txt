Chapter 2. The Trap Closes.

Washington marches his army south, coordinating with French General Rochambeau. The French fleet under Admiral de Grasse sails into Chesapeake Bay, defeating the British navy and blocking Cornwallis's escape by sea. American and French forces surround Yorktown by land. Cornwallis is trapped.

For weeks, we bombard Yorktown. French artillery pounds British positions. We dig trenches closer and closer to their fortifications. I watch as my father and other soldiers storm British redoubts in night attacks. The British are running out of food, ammunition, and hope. Cornwallis tries to escape across the York River but is turned back by a storm.
