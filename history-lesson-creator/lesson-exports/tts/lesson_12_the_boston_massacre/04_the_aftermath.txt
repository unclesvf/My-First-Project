Chapter 4. The Aftermath.

The day after the shooting, acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson met with angry town leaders. Thousands of armed colonists gathered on the Common. The message was clear: remove the troops or face an uprising. Hutchinson, fearing a full-scale rebellion, ordered the British regiments to withdraw to Castle Island in the harbor.

For the first time, colonial pressure had forced Britain to back down through the threat of violence. We'd learned that Britain would retreat when faced with unified, determined resistance. This lesson wouldn't be forgotten.

On the day of the funeral, shops closed and church bells tolled. Thousands of Bostonians marched behind the coffins of the five victims. Rich and poor, black and white, walked together. Crispus Attucks, a man of African and Native American descent, was buried alongside the white victims - in death, at least, they were equals.

Father closed our shop that day. "These men died because the tension between us and Britain has become unbearable," he said quietly. "Their blood is on Britain's hands, but also on ours. We've been heading toward violence for years. This won't be the end of it." Looking at his worried face, I feared he was right.
