Chapter 2. The Night of March 5.

On the cold evening of March 5, 1770, I heard shouting in the street. A crowd was harassing a British sentry, throwing snowballs and ice, calling him names. More soldiers came to help him. The crowd grew larger and angrier.

I watched from our window as people threw sticks, chunks of ice, anything they could grab. Someone rang the fire bell, bringing more townspeople into the streets. The crowd pressed closer to the soldiers, shouting "Fire! Fire!" Some meant it as a taunt - daring them to shoot.

Then shots rang out. The soldiers fired into the crowd. Five men fell dead or dying: Crispus Attucks, Samuel Gray, James Caldwell, Samuel Maverick, and Patrick Carr. Blood stained the snow. The crowd scattered in horror and rage.

I'll never forget that night - the shouts, the gunshots, the sight of men lying dead in the street. The next day, people called it the Boston Massacre. British soldiers had killed unarmed colonists in cold blood, they said. The soldiers claimed they fired in self-defense against a violent mob. Both stories are partly true.
