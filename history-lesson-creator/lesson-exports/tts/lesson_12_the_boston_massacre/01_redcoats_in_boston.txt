Chapter 1. Redcoats in Boston.

My name is Abigail, and I am fourteen years old. For the past two years, British soldiers - "redcoats" - have been stationed in Boston. There are thousands of them, living among us, a constant reminder of British power.

The soldiers were sent after more riots against British taxes. The Townshend Acts taxed tea, glass, paper, and paint. We resumed our boycotts, and Britain sent troops to enforce order. Now tensions simmer every day.

The soldiers compete with Bostonians for jobs, working for lower wages during their off-hours. They're loud and rowdy in the taverns. Street fights break out between soldiers and townspeople. People on both sides are angry, scared, looking for trouble.

My father's shop is on King Street, near the Custom House where British officials collect taxes. I see the hostility every day - townspeople glaring at redcoats, soldiers responding with contempt. It feels like a powder keg waiting for a spark.
