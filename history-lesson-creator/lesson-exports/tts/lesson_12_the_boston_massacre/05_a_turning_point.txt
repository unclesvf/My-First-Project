Chapter 5. A Turning Point.

In the months that followed, an uneasy quiet settled over Boston. Most of the Townshend Acts were repealed - except for the tax on tea, which Britain kept as a symbol of their right to tax us. The troops were gone from our streets. Life returned to something like normal.

But nothing was truly normal anymore. The Massacre had changed us. Every March 5, we held commemorations with speeches remembering the victims and denouncing British tyranny. The Sons of Liberty kept the memory alive, using it to fuel resistance.

I noticed how people spoke differently about Britain. Before, even those who opposed British policies still thought of themselves as loyal British subjects seeking their rights. Now, more people questioned whether we could remain part of the British Empire. Some whispered about independence, though that still seemed radical and frightening.

The Massacre taught both sides a terrible lesson. We learned that Britain would use military force against us. Britain learned that we would resist that force, even violently. The middle ground was disappearing. Each confrontation pushed us further apart.

Looking back now, I see the Boston Massacre as a turning point. Not because of what happened that night - a chaotic street fight that got out of hand - but because of what it represented. The bonds between Britain and America were breaking. Five men died on King Street, but the relationship between the colonies and the mother country died too. We were on a path toward something unprecedented, and there seemed to be no way to turn back.
