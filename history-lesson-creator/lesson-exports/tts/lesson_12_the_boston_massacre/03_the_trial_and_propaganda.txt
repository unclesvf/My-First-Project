Chapter 3. The Trial and Propaganda.

The soldiers were arrested and tried for murder. In a surprise move, John Adams - a patriot who opposes British policies - agreed to defend them. He believes even British soldiers deserve a fair trial and a good lawyer.

At trial, Adams argued the soldiers faced a violent, threatening mob and fired in self-defense. Most were acquitted; two were convicted of manslaughter and branded on the thumb. Many patriots were furious, feeling justice wasn't served.

But the real battle wasn't in the courtroom - it was for public opinion. Paul Revere created an engraving showing the Massacre as cold-blooded murder: organized British soldiers firing on peaceful colonists. The image spread throughout the colonies, inflaming anti-British sentiment.

The engraving wasn't accurate - it showed the soldiers in a neat line, the crowd as peaceful citizens. But propaganda doesn't have to be accurate to be effective. The image of British tyranny became fixed in colonial minds. The Massacre became a symbol, a rallying cry, proof that Britain would use violence against its own subjects.
