Welcome to today's history lesson. The Rough Rider President. Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive Era (1901-1909).

You will hear this story from Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President of the United States, nineteen oh one.

Chapter One. From Sickly Boy to Rough Rider.

My name is Theodore Roosevelt, and I was not supposed to survive childhood.

Born in 1858 to a wealthy New York family, I suffered from terrible asthma that left me gasping for breath, weak and confined indoors while other boys ran and played. Doctors told my parents I had a weak constitution. They said I would never be strong.

But my father — a man I admired more than anyone — took me aside one day. "Theodore," he said, "you have the mind but not the body, and without the body the mind cannot go as far as it should. You must make your body."

Those words changed everything.

I threw myself into physical training like my life depended on it — because it did. Boxing, weightlifting, horseback riding, hiking in all weather. I pushed myself until I could barely stand, then pushed further. Slowly, painfully, I transformed from a gasping invalid into something stronger. I learned a lesson I never forgot: with enough determination, a person can remake himself entirely.

Harvard, politics, marriage to my sweetheart Alice — life was moving fast. Then 1884 destroyed me. My mother and my wife died on the same day, in the same house. Valentine's Day. I wrote in my diary: "The light has gone out of my life."

I fled to the Dakota Territory. Ranched cattle. Hunted buffalo. Captured horse thieves. Lived rough among rough men. The West rebuilt me. When I came back East, I was harder, readier, hungrier for the fight ahead.

When war with Spain came in 1898, I couldn't watch from behind a desk. I resigned my comfortable position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy and formed a volunteer cavalry regiment — the newspapers called us "Roosevelt's Rough Riders." We charged up San Juan Hill in Cuba, and I came home a hero. Governor of New York followed. Then Vice President under McKinley.

The party bosses thought they were burying me in that useless job. They were wrong.

Chapter Two. An Accidental President.

September 14, 1901. I became President at age forty-two, the youngest man ever to hold the office.

I didn't want it to happen this way.

President McKinley had been shot by an anarchist eight days earlier in Buffalo. I rushed there when I got word he was dying, but arrived too late. He was gone. The oath of office was administered to me in a borrowed house, surrounded by weeping cabinet members.

Mark Hanna, the Republican boss who'd engineered my exile to the vice presidency, said what everyone was thinking: "Now that damn cowboy is President!"

He was right to worry. I had no intention of warming a chair for four years.

I told the press I would continue McKinley's cabinet — stability mattered during a transition. But I also made it clear things would be different now. "I wish to be a good President," I said. "And to do that I must have the support of the people."

The presidency gave me something wonderful: a bully pulpit. A platform to speak directly to ordinary Americans, over the heads of the bosses and the moneymen. And I intended to use it.

My philosophy was simple. A Square Deal for every American. Government shouldn't favor capital over labor or labor over capital. It should be an honest broker, making sure no one group crushes the others. That was considered radical in 1901. Most people thought government should stay out of business entirely.

I thought that was nonsense. When the game is rigged, the referee has to step in.

Chapter Three. Trust-Busting and the Square Deal.

America in 1901 was run by a handful of men. J.P. Morgan controlled the banks. Rockefeller controlled the oil. A few railroad barons controlled how anything got anywhere. These "trusts" fixed prices, destroyed competitors, exploited workers, and bought politicians like other men buy cigars.

Previous presidents had looked the other way. I couldn't.

My first major fight was against the Northern Securities Company — a railroad monopoly that Morgan himself had stitched together. When Morgan heard I was suing to break it up, he came to the White House personally. "If we have done anything wrong," he said, in that imperious way of his, "send your man to my man and they can fix it up."

I told him flatly: "That can't be done."

Morgan looked at me like I'd grown a second head. He was used to presidents who knew their place. I wasn't going to be one of them.

We won in the Supreme Court. The newspapers started calling me "Trust-Buster." Over my presidency we brought forty-four antitrust suits. I wasn't against big business — large companies can be efficient, can do things small ones can't. But they had to play fair. They had to serve the public, not just their stockholders.

The coal strike of 1902 tested me. Miners in Pennsylvania, working in hellish conditions for starvation wages, walked off the job. The mine owners refused to even talk to them. Winter was coming. Americans would freeze without coal.

Previous presidents would have sent in troops to crush the strike. I did the opposite. I threatened to seize the mines and run them with the Army unless the owners came to the table. They were stunned. A president siding with workers over capital? Unheard of.

They agreed to arbitration. The miners got better wages and shorter hours. For the first time, a president had used federal power to help working men rather than club them.

Chapter Four. Conservation: Preserving What Cannot Be Replaced.

Of everything I did as President, I am proudest of conservation.

I grew up loving nature. Birds, forests, wild places. Out West as a young man, I saw what greed was doing — forests stripped to stumps, buffalo slaughtered to near extinction, beautiful country ruined for quick profit. It made me sick. I realized that unless someone stopped it, my grandchildren would inherit a wasteland.

Conservation doesn't mean locking wilderness away and never touching it. It means using resources wisely, making them last. A forest can provide timber forever if you harvest it right. Strip it bare and it's gone.

I used every tool I had. I established five National Parks, eighteen National Monuments, fifty-one Bird Reserves, a hundred and fifty National Forests. Roughly 230 million acres, protected. I created the Forest Service and put Gifford Pinchot in charge — a man who understood that conservation was about science, not sentiment.

Congress tried to stop me. They passed a bill taking away my authority to create new National Forests in the West. So Pinchot and I worked through the night, designating twenty-one new forests before I signed their bill. They were furious. The forests were saved.

I camped with John Muir in Yosemite, slept under the giant sequoias, and promised him those ancient trees would stand forever. I saved the Grand Canyon, Devils Tower, Muir Woods. I saved the bison from extinction.

These places belong to all Americans, not just the men who want to cut them down or dig them up. That was worth fighting for.

Chapter Five. Speaking Softly, Carrying a Big Stick.

"Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far."

An old West African proverb. I made it my motto. America should be strong — strong enough that we don't have to prove it by fighting. A big navy means other nations think twice before making trouble. That's how you keep peace.

I built the Navy up to world-class. When critics said it cost too much, I pointed out that wars cost more. I sent the Great White Fleet around the world — sixteen battleships circling the globe — to show the flag and remind everyone that America was a power now.

The Panama Canal was my proudest achievement in foreign affairs. For centuries, ships had to sail all the way around South America to get from one ocean to the other. Madness. A canal through Central America would change everything.

Colombia wouldn't cooperate. Their province of Panama wanted independence anyway. I helped them get it. Some people called that imperialism. I called it getting the job done. The canal opened in 1914 — one of the greatest engineering feats in history. Ships still use it every day.

In 1905, I mediated peace between Russia and Japan, ending their war before it spread further. First American president to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Proved we could make peace as well as threaten war.

Chapter Six. The Bully Pulpit.

I loved being President. Every morning I woke up excited about the fights ahead.

I broke rules constantly. Invited Booker T. Washington to dinner at the White House — the first Black American to receive that honor. Southerners were outraged. I didn't care. A man's worth isn't determined by his skin.

I pushed through the Pure Food and Drug Act after reading "The Jungle" — a novel about the meatpacking industry that would turn anyone's stomach. I regulated railroads, protected consumers, stood up for workers.

I believed in what I called the stewardship theory. The President serves the people. He should do whatever is necessary for their welfare unless the Constitution explicitly forbids it. That was revolutionary. Earlier presidents sat back and waited for Congress to act. I acted first and let Congress catch up.

When I left office in 1909 — voluntarily, after nearly two full terms — I was only fifty years old. Younger than most presidents when they start. I had transformed the office from something relatively weak into the center of American government.

My cousin Franklin would build on what I started, during the Depression. The New Deal grew from the Square Deal. Federal power used to help ordinary people against forces too big for them to fight alone.

That's what I'm proudest of, in the end. Not the trophies or the battles or the headlines. I proved that government could be a force for good. That a president could fight for fairness without destroying the system. A Square Deal: justice and opportunity for everyone, special privileges for no one.

That should be every president's goal. It was mine.

This concludes today's lesson. The Rough Rider President. Thank you for listening.
