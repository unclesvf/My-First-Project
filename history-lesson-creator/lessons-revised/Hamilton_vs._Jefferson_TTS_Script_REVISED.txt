Welcome to today's history lesson. Hamilton vs. Jefferson. Federalists vs. Democratic-Republicans (1790s).

You will hear this story from Samuel, age fifteen, son of a Virginia farmer, seventeen ninety-six.

Chapter One. Two Visions.

I'm Samuel, fifteen years old, and America is splitting in two.

Not with armies — with ideas.

Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson hate each other. Truly hate each other. And their fight is becoming everyone's fight.

Hamilton wants factories and banks and cities. He wants a strong central government that helps merchants and businessmen build an economy like Britain's. He thinks educated, wealthy men should lead.

Jefferson wants farms and independence and space. He wants state governments to stay strong and the federal government to stay small. He thinks ordinary people — farmers like my father — can govern themselves.

Father reads Jefferson's speeches aloud at dinner. "That's what we fought for," he says. "Not to create American kings and aristocrats. To be free."

But our neighbor Mr. Peterson sees it differently. He was a merchant before he retired here. He thinks Hamilton is saving the country. "Without a strong government and a sound economy, we'll fall apart," he says.

They used to be friends. Now they barely speak.

Chapter Two. Parties.

People are taking sides, and they're giving the sides names.

Hamilton's people call themselves Federalists. Merchants, bankers, manufacturers — mostly city people, mostly in the North. They want a federal government that does things.

Jefferson's people call themselves Democratic-Republicans, or just Republicans. Farmers, planters, working people — mostly in the South and the West. They want the federal government to leave them alone.

Father is a Republican. "We didn't fight Britain so that bankers in Philadelphia could run our lives," he says.

Mr. Peterson is a Federalist. "We need order and stability. Jefferson's ideas will lead to chaos."

I watch them argue and think: they both love America. They both want what's best. But they can't even agree on what "best" means.

The Founders didn't want parties. Washington warned us against them. But here we are anyway. Maybe Americans just disagree too much about important things to avoid them.

Chapter Three. The Newspaper Wars.

The fights happen in newspapers now. Each side has its own papers, and they're vicious.

Federalist papers say Jefferson is a dangerous radical who'll bring French-style guillotines to America. They say he's an atheist, a coward, a friend to mobs and chaos.

Republican papers say Hamilton wants to be king. They say Federalists want to crush ordinary people under the boots of bankers and aristocrats. They say Adams is a tyrant waiting for his chance.

I read both at the general store. It's like they're describing two different countries.

"Is any of this true?" I asked Father.

He looked uncomfortable. "Some of it. Exaggerated, but some of it."

"Then how do I know what to believe?"

He didn't have an answer. Nobody does.

Last week, one paper printed that Hamilton was having an affair. Another paper printed that Jefferson had children with a woman he enslaved. I don't know if either story is true. But people believe what they want to believe.

Mother says men always think their arguments are important enough to destroy friendships over. "But maybe," she added, "at least now people know where candidates stand. That's something."

Chapter Four. France and Britain.

The arguments got worse when France went to war with Britain.

We have a treaty with France — they helped us win our independence. Jefferson thinks we should help them. They're having their own revolution, throwing off kings, declaring the rights of man.

But the French Revolution got bloody. They executed the king. They executed thousands. The guillotine works all day. Federalists are horrified.

Hamilton says we owe France nothing. The treaty was with the French king, and he's dead. Besides, Britain is our biggest trading partner. We shouldn't ruin our economy for French revolutionaries.

Washington declared neutrality. Help neither side. Stay out of it.

Both sides were furious.

Father and his friends burned a dummy of John Jay when he negotiated a treaty with Britain. "We're crawling back to them!" they shouted. "We're betraying France!"

I watched the flames and thought: we're arguing about other people's wars now. About which foreign country we like better. How did that become an American fight?

But it has. Federalists see Britain as the model — orderly, stable, prosperous. Republicans see France — revolutionary, democratic, fighting against kings.

Which kind of country do we want to be? That's what we're really arguing about.

Chapter Five. The Election.

Washington retired in 1796. First real election for president.

John Adams, Federalist, against Thomas Jefferson, Republican.

The newspaper attacks were brutal. Adams wants to be king. Jefferson will destroy religion. Adams hates liberty. Jefferson loves mobs.

Father was certain Jefferson would win. "People are tired of Federalists serving the rich."

Mr. Peterson was certain Adams would win. "People aren't fools. They know we need stability."

Adams won. Barely.

But here's the strange part — Jefferson came second, so he became vice president. The president and vice president from opposing parties. Two men who represent completely different visions of America, running the government together.

"How is that supposed to work?" I asked Father.

"It isn't," he said. "But that's what the Constitution says."

I think about that a lot. We built a system, and now the system is making us live with people we disagree with. Maybe that's the point. Maybe democracy means learning to share a country with people who see everything differently.

Or maybe it just means more arguments. I guess we'll find out.

Chapter Six. What It Means.

I've been watching Federalists and Republicans fight for years now. I've seen friendships break. I've seen neighbors who won't look at each other.

But I've also seen something else.

Father and Mr. Peterson yell at each other about politics. They write angry letters to newspapers. They vote against each other's candidates.

But when Mr. Peterson's barn burned last spring, Father was there with buckets before the flames were out. When our well went dry, Mr. Peterson let us use his. They still help each other with harvests. They still nod when they pass on the road.

The newspapers say the other side is evil. But I know the people on both sides. They're not evil. They're scared. They love this country and they're scared the other side will ruin it.

Maybe that's what political parties are — organized fear. But maybe they're also how we fight without killing each other. We argue with words instead of guns. We vote instead of revolt. We call each other names instead of raising armies.

Mother says that's something. Father says it's not enough.

I don't know who's right. But I know this: we're still one country. Barely. Angrily. But still one country.

I hope we stay that way.

This concludes today's lesson. Hamilton vs. Jefferson. Thank you for listening.
