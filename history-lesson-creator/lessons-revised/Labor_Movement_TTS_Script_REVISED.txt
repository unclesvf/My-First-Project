Welcome to today's history lesson. Labor Movement. Workers Unite (1877-1914).

You will hear this story from Michael, age seventeen, factory worker, eighteen eighty-six.

Chapter One. The Eight-Hour Day.

I'm Michael, seventeen years old, and I work in a factory in Chicago making agricultural equipment. I work fourteen hours a day, six days a week. Start at six in the morning, finish at eight at night.

By the time I get home, eat dinner, and sleep, there's no time for anything else. No education. No family. Just work, sleep, work, sleep.

This is normal for American workers in the 1880s. Factory workers, miners, railroad men — we all work twelve to fourteen hours daily. Children as young as ten work the same hours.

But workers are organizing.

The eight-hour day movement demands a basic reform. "Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will" — that's our slogan.

It seems reasonable. But employers resist fiercely. They say shorter hours would reduce profits. They say workers would waste free time drinking.

Labor unions are growing. The Knights of Labor has seven hundred thousand members. The movement is building.

May 1, 1886 — May Day. Hundreds of thousands of workers across America strike for the eight-hour day. In Chicago, eighty thousand walk off jobs. Factories shut down.

I join the strike. We march through the streets carrying signs. Employers call us radicals. Police watch us, hands on clubs.

The strike is mostly peaceful. But tensions are rising. Some employers hire strikebreakers. Fights break out.

The atmosphere is tense. Potentially violent.

Chapter Two. Haymarket.

May 3, 1886. Police attack striking workers at the McCormick Reaper Works. Two die. Labor activists call for a protest rally the next evening at Haymarket Square.

May 4. About three thousand people gather. Speakers denounce police violence. The mayor attends and later says the rally was peaceful. He leaves around ten when the crowd thins.

Around ten-thirty, police march on the remaining crowd and order them to disperse. The rally is peaceful and legal. But police want it ended.

Then it happens.

Someone throws a bomb into the police ranks. Explosion. One officer dies instantly. Police open fire. Workers fire back — some are armed. The shooting lasts minutes but feels like hours.

Seven police officers dead. At least four civilians. Dozens wounded. No one knows who threw the bomb. The bomber was never identified.

Chicago authorities blame anarchists. They arrest eight labor leaders. No evidence links them to the bombing — only speeches advocating workers' rights.

All eight are convicted. Four are hanged. One commits suicide. Three get life sentences. The governor later pardons the survivors, calling the trial unjust.

The Haymarket Affair devastates the labor movement. Employers paint all unions as dangerous anarchists. The Knights of Labor collapses. Workers are afraid to organize.

Chapter Three. The AFL.

After Haymarket, labor organizers change tactics.

Samuel Gompers builds the American Federation of Labor. The AFL takes a different approach.

It organizes only skilled workers — carpenters, machinists, printers. Skilled workers have bargaining power because they're harder to replace.

The AFL focuses on "bread and butter" issues: wages, hours, working conditions. It avoids radical politics. No talk of overthrowing capitalism. Just better pay and shorter hours.

The AFL uses collective bargaining — negotiating with employers as a group. When employers refuse, they strike. But AFL strikes are disciplined, organized.

By 1900, the AFL has one million members. Some unions achieve the eight-hour day.

But the AFL's success is limited. It organizes only about ten percent of the workforce. The skilled elite.

I'm not a skilled craftsman, so the AFL won't accept me. I'm still working fourteen-hour days with no union protection.

The fundamental problem remains: workers have no power individually. Only collective organization gives us power. But organizing is dangerous — employers fire union members, blacklist them, attack strikes.

Chapter Four. Triangle.

March 25, 1911. A fire breaks out at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York. Top three floors of a ten-story building. Five hundred workers, mostly young immigrant women.

The fire starts in a scrap bin and spreads through the fabric-filled workspace. Workers rush to escape.

But the owners have locked the exit doors. They say it prevents theft.

Women pound on locked doors, screaming. Some break windows and jump from the eighth, ninth, tenth floors. Firefighters' ladders only reach the sixth. Safety nets break under falling bodies.

Less than thirty minutes. One hundred forty-six dead. Girls as young as fourteen burned alive because doors were locked.

I read about it in the newspapers. Bodies piled in stairwells. Women jumping, clothes on fire.

The factory owners are tried for manslaughter. Acquitted — they claim they didn't know the doors were locked.

Later, a civil suit finds them liable. They pay seventy-five dollars per victim. A pittance for a life.

The Triangle Fire becomes a turning point. Public outrage forces politicians to act. New York passes fire safety laws, factory inspection laws, limits on hours for women and children.

The tragedy proves workers need government protection, not just unions.

Change comes slowly. Purchased with workers' lives.

Chapter Five. The Struggle Continues.

By 1914, I'm forty-five. I've been a factory worker my entire adult life.

The labor movement has made progress, but it's slow and costly.

Some workers have won the eight-hour day. Some states have passed safety laws and child labor restrictions.

But most workers still labor long hours in dangerous conditions for low pay. Employers still fire union organizers. Courts issue injunctions breaking strikes. Police attack picket lines.

I think about the Haymarket martyrs, hanged for advocating workers' rights. I think about the Triangle victims, burned alive because owners locked doors.

Labor's victories come through struggle and sacrifice. Every reform — shorter hours, safety regulations, minimum wages — is opposed fiercely and won only through strikes and organizing.

Some say the system is fundamentally unjust. Workers should own the factories. Others say the system can be fixed with regulations and gradual reforms.

I'm not sure who's right. But I know workers deserve better.

Fair wages. Safe conditions. Reasonable hours. Respect.

My son is fourteen now, starting factory work like I did.

I hope his generation will have better. I hope the labor movement will win real power.

That's what this is about — not just wages and hours, but human dignity.

The fight is far from over.

This concludes today's lesson. Labor Movement. Thank you for listening.
