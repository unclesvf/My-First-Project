Welcome to today's history lesson. The Southern Way. Southern Colonies and the Growth of Slavery (1660-1700).

You will hear this story from Thomas, age fourteen, son of a small tobacco farmer in Virginia, sixteen ninety.

Chapter One. Life on a Small Farm.

My name is Thomas, and I am fourteen years old. My family owns a small tobacco farm in Virginia. We're not wealthy planters with hundreds of acres — just fifty acres, enough to make a modest living.

We don't own enslaved workers. Father, my older brother William, and I do all the work ourselves. Planting in spring, tending the plants all summer, harvest in fall. Backbreaking work under the hot Virginia sun. Mother and my sister help cure the tobacco leaves and keep the household running.

Most families in Virginia are like us — small farmers, not wealthy planters. But the big planters have the power. They own thousands of acres and use enslaved African people to work their fields. These plantations produce most of Virginia's tobacco and make their owners very rich.

Father says the colony is changing. When he was young, most workers were indentured servants — they worked for several years, then went free. Now more and more planters are buying enslaved Africans who will never be free. Nor will their children.

Chapter Two. The Growth of Slavery.

Our neighbor, Mister Randolph, owns two hundred acres and twenty enslaved workers. I've seen them in his fields from dawn to dusk, with an overseer watching, whip in hand. They live in small wooden cabins and grow their own food in tiny gardens.

Last month a ship arrived from Africa with eighty enslaved people. Mister Randolph bought three — two men and a woman. They looked terrified and exhausted. They didn't speak English. They'd been torn from their families and everything they knew.

Watching them, I felt sick to my stomach.

Father saw my face. He said quietly, "This is wrong, Thomas. But it's becoming the foundation of our colony."

The laws are getting worse. A new one says children born to enslaved mothers will also be enslaved for life, no matter who the father is. Another forbids enslaved people from carrying weapons, gathering together, or learning to read. These laws treat human beings as property.

I asked Father why we don't speak out. He went quiet for a long time. Then he said, "Those who do are shunned. They lose business. They're called troublemakers. The people who profit from slavery have all the power — they make the laws. They've convinced themselves it's acceptable because enslaved people are different from us." He shook his head. "That's a lie we tell ourselves to justify evil."

Chapter Three. Different Souths.

The Southern colonies aren't all the same. Virginia and Maryland grow tobacco. South Carolina grows rice in coastal swamps — the work is brutal, deadly. The rice fields have to be flooded and drained, and workers labor in water up to their knees, plagued by mosquitoes and fever. In some parts of the Carolinas, enslaved people outnumber free people.

What we share is the plantation system — warm climate, long growing seasons, soil perfect for crops that sell high in England. Tobacco, rice, later cotton. These crops need enormous amounts of labor. That's why planters turned to slavery.

It creates a rigid order. Wealthy planters at the top — they control the government, make the laws. Below them, small farmers like my family. Then poor whites and indentured servants. And at the bottom, treated not as people but as property, enslaved Africans.

It's different from what I hear about New England, where most people are small farmers or merchants. Different from the Middle Colonies with all their religions and trade. The South is building its wealth on slavery. I'm starting to understand that choices like this have consequences that last a long, long time.

Chapter Four. How We Got Here.

I've been thinking about what Father said. How did we end up here? How did English people who came seeking freedom create something that takes freedom away?

Father explained it started slowly. First, colonists used indentured servants. But servants eventually went free and wanted their own land. Some planters tried enslaving Native people, but they knew the land and could escape. African people, brought by force across the ocean, were far from home with nowhere to run.

As tobacco made more money, slavery became more profitable. Planters started telling themselves enslaved Africans were inferior — that slavery was natural, even good for them. They made laws to lock it in place. Hereditary. Permanent. They built an entire economy on cruelty.

But Father reminds me it didn't have to be this way. The Northern colonies are moving away from slavery. Some Quakers in Pennsylvania speak against it. Even a few Southerners know it's wrong.

"What we build now," Father told me, "will shape what America becomes. And I fear we're building on sand and blood."

I'm only fourteen. But I understand I'm watching something terrible take root — something that will divide us for generations. I wonder if the people who come after us will understand why we didn't stop it.

Chapter Five. Small Resistances.

Last week, three enslaved people escaped from Randolph's plantation. They disappeared into the forest, heading north. Randolph hired men with dogs to track them. Two were caught and whipped in public, as a warning to the others. The third — a young man named Samuel — was never found. I hope he made it.

Once I started looking, I noticed small acts of resistance everywhere. Enslaved workers slow down when overseers aren't watching. They break tools "accidentally." They sing songs with hidden meanings about freedom and deliverance. One woman Father knows keeps a garden where she grows African plants from seeds she somehow brought across the ocean. Small things. But they preserve something human against a system that tries to crush it out.

At church, the minister preaches that slavery is God's will. He quotes Bible verses about servants obeying masters. But Father showed me other passages — about treating others the way you want to be treated, about justice, about freedom. "The Bible can be twisted to justify anything," he said. "You have to choose what kind of person you'll be."

Our family will never own enslaved people. We'll stay small farmers and do our own work. It's not enough. We should speak out louder. But it's something.

Father says every person has to decide whether to go along with evil or resist it, even in small ways. I'm choosing resistance. Someday, I hope this terrible thing will end — though I fear it may take something catastrophic to tear out what we've planted so deep.

This concludes today's lesson. The Southern Way. Thank you for listening.
