Welcome to today's history lesson. Triangular Trade. Colonial Economy and Atlantic Trade (1650-1750).

You will hear this story from James, age fifteen, son of a merchant ship captain in Boston, seventeen twenty.

Chapter One. A Merchant's Life.

My name is James, and I am fifteen years old. My father captains a merchant ship that sails the Atlantic, and I've been on three voyages with him now. Mostly I keep the ledgers — tracking what we load, what we sell, what we owe. Numbers are my talent, Father says.

People call what we do the "triangular trade," though it's messier than that sounds. We carry goods between Boston and the Caribbean, sometimes down to Africa, sometimes across to England. Every port has something to sell and something it needs. Our job is to connect them.

Father owns part of the ship with two other merchants. They invested in this voyage: barrels of rum, dried cod, lumber, iron tools. If we sell well, everyone profits. If a storm sinks us, everyone loses.

We live in a fine brick house on the harbor now. I'll inherit the business someday.

But I've started noticing things I didn't notice when I was younger. Some of the other ships in port... they carry different cargo. Living cargo. Father won't sail those routes. But we trade with men who do. We buy their sugar. We sell them our rum.

I'm fifteen, and I'm already tangled up in something I don't know how to feel about.

Chapter Two. What the Colonies Make.

I've seen enough ports now to understand how this all fits together.

Here in New England, our soil is rocky and our winters are long. We're not farmers — we're sailors, shipbuilders, fishermen. We catch cod by the ton and dry it to ship to the Caribbean. We cut lumber from forests that seem to go on forever. We take molasses from the sugar islands and turn it into rum. Lots and lots of rum.

The Middle Colonies — New York, Pennsylvania — they're the farmers. Wheat and flour and bread, enough to feed half the Atlantic world. "Bread basket colonies," people call them. Their ships leave heavy and come back light.

Down South it's different. Virginia and Maryland grow tobacco. The Carolinas grow rice and something called indigo that makes blue dye. Those crops take enormous work — more work than any family could do alone. So the planters buy people to do it for them.

And the Caribbean. I've been to Barbados twice. Sugar everywhere. Fortunes made from it. And slaves dying to make those fortunes, worked until they drop, bodies dumped like trash. The Caribbean eats people alive. But England wants sugar in its tea, and so the ships keep coming.

Chapter Three. England's Rules.

We're not allowed to trade with just anyone. England has rules — the Navigation Acts, they're called.

We can only ship certain goods to England or English colonies. We have to use English ships with English crews. Valuable things like tobacco have to go to England first, even if someone in France would pay more for them.

Father explained it to me once. "We're supposed to make England rich," he said. "Send them raw materials. Buy their finished goods. That's the deal."

"But what if we could get a better price somewhere else?"

He gave me a look. "Then you become a smuggler. And if you're caught, you lose everything."

Some merchants do it anyway. I know they do. French molasses is cheaper than English molasses, and nobody looks too hard at the barrels. But Father follows the rules, even when it costs us. "We're Englishmen," he says. "Until we're not."

I don't know what he means by that last part. Maybe he doesn't either.

Chapter Four. The Auction.

We were in Charleston last spring when a slave ship came in. The Prosperity, it was called. I remember the name.

They brought the Africans up from the hold in groups. I could smell the ship from the dock — waste and sickness and something worse, something I couldn't name until I realized it was despair.

They were thin. Some could barely walk. A woman had to be carried. They'd been packed into that ship for weeks, chained below deck in the dark.

The auction was the next day. I went. I don't know why.

The auctioneer talked about them like horses. Checked their teeth, their muscles. Made them turn around. Called out prices while the bidders nodded and raised their hands. A mother screamed when they sold her son to a different man. They gagged her. The auction continued.

I didn't sleep that night. Or the next.

The sugar in our tea. The tobacco we ship. The molasses we turn into rum. It all connects back to this. The whole system, the whole triangle — it has people inside it. People who scream when their children are taken away.

Father says some Quakers in Philadelphia call slavery evil. They say it violates everything Christians are supposed to believe. But most people don't want to hear it. Slavery is too profitable. Too necessary, they say. Too built into everything.

I don't know what to do with what I saw. But I can't un-see it.

Chapter Five. What I'll Do.

I've made a decision. I haven't told Father yet because I don't know how.

When the business is mine, I won't trade in slave-produced goods. No sugar. No tobacco. No rice. No indigo.

I know what Father will say. He'll say I'm being impractical. That one merchant can't change anything. That I'll just make myself poor while everyone else gets rich.

Maybe he's right. Probably he's right.

But I can't go back to that dock in Charleston. I can't watch another auction and tell myself it's just business. I can't take the profit and pretend the screaming doesn't exist.

I've been reading pamphlets. There are people who say this whole system is wrong — not just cruel, but wrong in a way that God won't forgive. They say if all men are created equal, then we can't own each other. It's simple, when you say it out loud.

I don't know when this will change. Maybe not in my lifetime. Maybe my protest will mean nothing — just one merchant refusing to carry certain cargo, a tiny absence in the great churning engine of trade.

But I'll know. And my children will know. When someone asks what I did while this horror was happening, I'll have an answer.

That has to count for something.

This concludes today's lesson. Triangular Trade. Thank you for listening.
