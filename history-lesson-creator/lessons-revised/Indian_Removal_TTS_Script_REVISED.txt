Welcome to today's history lesson. Indian Removal. The Trail of Tears (1830-1838).

You will hear this story from Sarah, age fourteen, Cherokee girl, eighteen thirty-eight.

Chapter One. Our Cherokee Life.

I'm Sarah, fourteen years old, Cherokee. My people have lived in these Georgia mountains longer than anyone can remember.

We're not the "savages" white people imagine. I attend mission school where I'm learning English alongside Cherokee. My father farms cotton and corn. My mother weaves cloth as fine as anything in Philadelphia. We live in a proper house with a fireplace and glass windows.

We have our own written language now — Sequoyah created it. We have our own newspaper, the Cherokee Phoenix. We have a constitution modeled on America's. We thought this would save us.

We thought if we became "civilized" by their standards, they would let us stay.

We were wrong.

Georgia wants our land. Gold was discovered here, and now white settlers swarm over Cherokee territory, taking whatever they want. Georgia extended its laws over us, pretending we're not a sovereign nation, pretending we don't exist.

Father says President Jackson despises Indians. It doesn't matter how many books we read or how many churches we build. He wants our land for white settlers, and he'll take it.

Chapter Two. The Supreme Court.

Our leaders fought through the courts. Chief John Ross took our case all the way to the Supreme Court.

We won.

Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the Cherokee are a sovereign nation. Georgia has no authority over us. Our treaties are valid. Our rights are clear.

I remember Father's face when the news came. "American law recognizes us! The highest court in the land!"

Then we heard what Jackson said. They say his exact words were: "Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it."

The President of the United States refused to enforce the Supreme Court's ruling.

Father sat down heavily when he heard that. He didn't speak for a long time.

"What good are laws," he finally said, "if the man with the guns ignores them?"

I learned something that day. Justice without enforcement is just words.

Chapter Three. Soldiers Come.

Spring 1838. Seven thousand soldiers arrived with guns and bayonets.

They gave us no time. No time to gather belongings. No time to harvest crops. No time to bury our dead properly.

I watched soldiers drag families from their homes. Grandmother couldn't walk fast enough, so they pushed her. A baby was crying and they kept shouting for it to be quiet. Old Mr. Lowery tried to grab his Bible and a soldier knocked it from his hands.

White settlers waited nearby like vultures. Before we were even out of sight, they were moving into our houses. Taking our livestock. Claiming our fields.

They herded us into stockades — holding pens, really. Hundreds of families crowded together. Not enough food. Not enough water. Disease spreading.

We waited through summer in those camps. Some people died before the march even started.

"We built everything they asked us to build," Father said one night, staring at the stockade walls. "We learned everything they told us to learn. And still they take everything."

Chapter Four. The Trail Where We Cried.

October 1838. Over sixteen thousand Cherokee forced to march a thousand miles to Oklahoma.

We walked. When people couldn't walk anymore, they rode in wagons if there was room. Often there wasn't room.

My grandmother died in November. She just got too tired, too cold, too sick. We buried her somewhere in Tennessee. I don't know exactly where anymore.

My baby sister died of whooping cough three weeks later. She was three years old. Mother wrapped her body and we buried her by the trail with stones to mark the place.

We never finished grieving for Grandmother before we had to grieve for my sister.

People died every day. We buried them in shallow graves when we could. Sometimes we couldn't even stop long enough for that.

Some white people we passed threw stones at us. Others looked away. A few showed pity but didn't help.

We call it Nunna daul Tsuny in Cherokee. "The Trail Where They Cried."

Over four thousand of us died on that trail. A quarter of our people.

Chapter Five. What We Learned.

We reached Oklahoma in March 1839. The land here is different from our Georgia mountains. We had to start over with nothing.

Father survived the journey, but something in him broke.

"We tried everything," he says now. "Their ways, their language, their religion, their government, their courts. None of it mattered. They wanted our land, so they took it. That's the only truth."

They told us this land would be ours "as long as grass grows and water runs." We know what American promises are worth now.

I think about what we lost. Not just land and homes, but the graves of our ancestors. Sacred places. The mountains that held our stories.

I think about Grandmother, buried somewhere in Tennessee. About my sister, three years old, wrapped in blankets and left by a trail.

Someday Americans will debate whether removal was "necessary." Whether it was "really that bad." Whether the country "needed" our land.

I was there. I watched my grandmother and baby sister die because white settlers wanted gold and cotton land.

I know the truth.

This was evil. America knew it was evil. And they did it anyway.

The United States calls itself a beacon of liberty. But liberty didn't extend to us. Rights didn't protect us. The Supreme Court ruled in our favor, and it meant nothing.

We learned what "all men are created equal" really means in America. It means some men. White men. Not us.

The Trail of Tears taught us that in this country, power matters more than justice. And white land hunger matters more than Cherokee lives.

This concludes today's lesson. Indian Removal. Thank you for listening.
