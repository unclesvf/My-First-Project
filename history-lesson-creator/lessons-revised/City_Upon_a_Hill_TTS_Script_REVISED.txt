Welcome to today's history lesson. City Upon a Hill. The Massachusetts Bay Colony (1630-1650).

You will hear this story from John, age thirteen, son of a Puritan minister in Boston, sixteen thirty.

Chapter One. A Holy Experiment.

My name is John, and I am thirteen years old. My father is a Puritan minister who came to Massachusetts Bay with Governor Winthrop. We're not like the Pilgrims down at Plymouth — they wanted to break away from the Church of England entirely. We want to fix it. Purify it from the inside, Father says.

On the ship coming over, Governor Winthrop gave a sermon I'll never forget. He said we were building "a city upon a hill" — a place so godly, so perfect, that the whole world would look at us and see how Christians ought to live.

No pressure.

We arrived with nearly a thousand people, which makes us much bigger than Plymouth ever was. We have money, supplies, educated men. The company charter lets us govern ourselves, and we brought it with us — so England can't easily tell us what to do from three thousand miles away.

But freedom here doesn't mean what I thought it meant. Everyone must attend our church. No other beliefs allowed. Father says true freedom is the freedom to do what's right, not the freedom to sin. I nod when he says this, but late at night I wonder: who decides what's right?

Chapter Two. Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson.

I've learned that asking questions in Massachusetts can get you into serious trouble.

Roger Williams was a young minister, smart and passionate. He preached that the government had no business telling people how to worship. He said we should actually pay the Indians for their land instead of just taking it and calling it God's will.

The magistrates called him dangerous. They banished him — in the middle of winter. He would have frozen to death, but the Narragansett Indians took him in. He went south and started Rhode Island, where anyone can worship however they want. Some people call it "Rogue's Island" and spit when they say it. But others whisper about it like it's something wonderful.

Then there was Anne Hutchinson. She was a woman — a mother of fifteen children — who held Bible study meetings in her home. She had her own ideas about salvation, and women came from all over to hear her.

The magistrates hated her. A woman, teaching theology? Challenging ministers? They put her on trial. I snuck into the back of the meetinghouse to watch.

She was brilliant. Every Scripture they threw at her, she threw one back. She argued circles around men who'd been to Cambridge. It didn't matter. They'd decided before the trial began. They banished her too.

She ended up in New York, where she was killed in an Indian raid. The ministers said it was God's judgment. But I lay awake that night thinking: we left England because they persecuted us. Now we persecute others. How is that different?

Chapter Three. Sundays and Scrutiny.

Living in our "city upon a hill" means everyone watches everyone else.

Last Sunday, the Goodman family got fined because their son laughed during the sermon. He's eight. He saw a dog wander into the meetinghouse and he giggled. Now his father owes money and the whole town knows their family was "disorderly."

Our Sabbath starts Saturday at sunset and doesn't end until Sunday at sunset. No cooking, no working, no playing. We go to meeting twice — morning and afternoon — and each service lasts three hours or more. Father preaches about sin and hellfire while we sit on hard wooden benches. In winter, I can't feel my fingers or toes by the end.

The tithing man walks the aisles with a long pole. Feather on one end to tickle women awake. Hard wooden knob on the other end for men and boys. I've felt that knob on my skull twice. It hurts for days.

We can't wear bright colors. No ribbons, no lace, no jewelry. When a woman from England visited wearing a purple ribbon in her hair, the magistrates made her take it off in front of everyone. Mother whispered that the woman cried.

I understand we're supposed to be godly. I understand vanity is a sin. But sometimes I think we spend so much time watching each other for sin that we forget to watch for goodness.

Chapter Four. Growing Pains.

Despite everything, the colony grew fast. By 1640, we had twenty thousand people — more than any other English colony in America.

We built towns the same way everywhere: meetinghouse in the center, green common for the cattle, houses clustered around. Every town with fifty families has to hire a schoolmaster. Reading matters here — how else can you study Scripture for yourself? We started Harvard College in 1636 to train new ministers.

Our town meetings are something special. Church members gather to make decisions together — who gets which land, what the tax should be, how to deal with wolves killing sheep. Not everyone can participate, just male church members. But those who can really do have a voice. Father says it's self-government, which is godlier than being ruled by kings and bishops who don't know your name.

I went to my first town meeting last month. Men argued for hours about where to put a new road. It was boring and frustrating and took forever. But by the end, they'd decided together, and everyone accepted it.

That seems important, even if I can't quite explain why.

Chapter Five. Questions Without Answers.

I'm seventeen now. Four years of watching and thinking and keeping my mouth shut.

We came here to build a perfect Christian society. And we've built something — schools, churches, towns, farms, a college. When families struggle, neighbors come together to help raise barns and bring in harvests. When sickness comes, we care for each other. That's real. That matters.

But we also banish people for their beliefs. We whip Quakers and cut off their ears. We hang people we suspect of witchcraft. We take Indian land and tell ourselves God wants us to have it.

Father says my doubts are the Devil whispering. Maybe he's right. But I don't think God gave us minds so we'd stop using them.

Here's what I've figured out: Governor Winthrop was right that the world would watch us. But maybe not for the reasons he thought. Maybe they'll watch to see what happens when people try to build a perfect society — how we succeed, and how we fail. Maybe they'll learn from both.

A city upon a hill. Everyone can see it, Father used to say. That's the point.

But that means they can see everything. The good and the bad. The charity and the cruelty. The prayer and the punishment.

I hope whatever they see teaches them something true.

This concludes today's lesson. City Upon a Hill. Thank you for listening.
