Welcome to today's history lesson. French and Indian War. The Seven Years' War in America (1754-1763).

You will hear this story from Benjamin, age sixteen, a colonial militiaman from Virginia, seventeen fifty-five.

Chapter One. Clash of Empires.

My name is Benjamin, and I am sixteen years old. Last spring I lied about my age and joined the Virginia militia. My mother cried. My father shook my hand. Now I'm following a young officer named George Washington into wilderness I've never seen, beyond the mountains where the land belongs to no one — or everyone, depending on who you ask.

We're here because England and France both want the Ohio Valley. The French have been building forts all through this country, a chain connecting Canada to Louisiana. They trade with the Indians — the Shawnee, the Delaware, others whose names I'm still learning. We English want the land for farms and settlements. Someone was always going to fight over it.

My first battle was in May, near a place called Great Meadows. I didn't know what I expected. Not the noise — the guns were so loud I couldn't think. Not the smoke. Not the way a man looks when he falls. We won, they said. It didn't feel like winning.

Young Washington built a fort out of logs and named it Fort Necessity. A month later, a French and Indian force surrounded us — three times our number, maybe more. We fought in the rain all day, water pouring into the trenches, powder getting wet. By nightfall Washington surrendered.

They let us walk away. Small mercy. But I understood something that day: the French and their Indian allies knew this land. We were strangers here, fumbling in forests we couldn't read. This war would not be what we thought it would be.

Chapter Two. Braddock's Defeat.

The next summer, the British sent us a real general. Edward Braddock, with two regiments of professional soldiers in red coats. We were going to take Fort Duquesne from the French — the place where Pittsburgh is now, where the rivers meet.

Braddock was... confident. Very confident. His soldiers marched in formation through the forest, drums beating, flags flying. Beautiful, in a way. Washington and some other colonials tried to warn him. "This isn't Europe," they said. "You can't fight this way here."

Braddock called us provincials. Said we knew nothing of proper warfare.

July 9th. We were crossing near the Monongahela River when the forest exploded. Gunfire from everywhere — from behind trees, from rocks, from places I couldn't see. The French and their Indian allies were ghosts. Our soldiers stood in their neat lines and died in their neat lines. The red coats made them easy targets. Officers on horses went down first.

I survived by diving behind a fallen log and shooting at movement. I don't know if I hit anyone. I hope I didn't. I hope I did. I still don't know which.

General Braddock took a bullet through his lungs. Washington had two horses shot out from under him but somehow lived. Out of thirteen hundred men, we lost nearly a thousand.

I carried a wounded man for miles during the retreat. He died before we made camp. I didn't even know his name.

Chapter Three. The Tide Turns.

For years after that, we lost. The French won everywhere. Their Indian allies raided frontier settlements — burned farms, killed families, took captives. People fled east, abandoning everything they'd built. I started to wonder if we'd lose the whole continent.

Then Britain got serious. A man named William Pitt took charge and decided America mattered. He sent more troops, more money, better officers. He stopped treating us colonials like useless children and started using what we knew.

Fort Duquesne fell. Then Louisbourg, up north. Then one by one, the French positions crumbled.

The big moment came in 1759. British general James Wolfe took his army up the cliffs outside Quebec City at night — a crazy plan that shouldn't have worked. The French commander, Montcalm, came out to meet them on the Plains of Abraham. Both generals died in the battle. But the British won. And with Quebec, the war was basically over.

The treaty came in 1763. France gave up Canada and everything east of the Mississippi. Just... gave it up. Spain got Louisiana. Britain got everything else.

We celebrated in the streets. We'd won. The continent was ours.

We had no idea what that victory would cost us.

Chapter Four. Seeds of Something Else.

After the war, things got strange.

Britain was broke. They'd spent a fortune beating France, and now they had debts to pay. Someone in London decided the colonies should help — after all, the war had been fought to protect us. So they planned to keep ten thousand soldiers in America and send us the bill.

Then came the proclamation. The King drew a line along the Appalachian Mountains and told us we couldn't settle west of it. Couldn't claim the land. Couldn't even go there.

I'd fought for that land. Friends of mine died for it. And now some minister in London who'd never seen a forest told me I couldn't have it. They said it was to keep peace with the Indians, to prevent more wars. Maybe that was true. But it felt like betrayal.

The war changed other things too. For years, we'd needed Britain. The French had been right there, threatening us, and we needed British ships and soldiers to survive. But now France was gone. That fear was gone. And without it, I started to notice things I hadn't noticed before.

The way British officers talked to us. Like we were inferior. Like our courage didn't count because we weren't professional soldiers. Like being born in America made us less than being born in England.

I didn't feel less. I felt like I'd earned something. And I was getting tired of being told I hadn't.

Chapter Five. What Victory Costs.

I'm twenty-five now. Old enough to understand things I couldn't understand at sixteen.

We won the war. But winning means different things to different people.

I met a Shawnee man once, after the fighting ended. His name was Red Hawk. His people had fought alongside the French — not because they loved France, but because they knew what we were. An endless wave of settlers who wanted the land itself, not just trade.

"You won your war," he said to me. "But you've started one you don't understand yet. We won't simply disappear."

He was right. The year the peace treaty was signed, the tribes rose up. Pontiac's Rebellion, they called it. More fighting. More burning. More death. The war wasn't over — it had just changed shape.

And I think about us. The colonists. We won alongside Britain, and now Britain wants us to pay for the privilege. They want to tax us and control us and tell us where we can live. Twelve years from now, we'll be fighting them.

I used to think wars ended. That you fought, someone won, and then it was over. I don't think that anymore. Every victory plants seeds for the next conflict. We beat France and created the conditions for our own rebellion. We took this land and ensured the Indians would resist us for generations.

Maybe nobody really wins a war. Maybe we all just trade one set of problems for another.

But I'm still glad I survived. And I'm still proud of what we did, even knowing what it led to. History is complicated that way.

This concludes today's lesson. French and Indian War. Thank you for listening.
