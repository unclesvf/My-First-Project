Welcome to today's history lesson. The War of 1812. Second War for Independence (1812-1815).

You will hear this story from Daniel, age sixteen, militiaman from Baltimore, eighteen fourteen.

Chapter One. Going to War Again.

I'm Daniel, sixteen years old, and we're fighting Britain again.

The reasons are confusing. Britain keeps stopping our ships, searching them, taking American sailors and forcing them to serve in the British navy. "Impressment," they call it. They claim the sailors are really British, but everyone knows that's an excuse.

Britain also helps the Indian tribes fight American settlers in the West. And some people in Congress — "War Hawks," they call them — want to conquer Canada and drive Britain off the continent entirely.

So we went to war. We shouldn't have.

Our army is weak and badly trained. Our invasions of Canada failed embarrassingly. British ships blockade our coast, strangling our trade. Up in New England, Federalist merchants are so angry about the war hurting their business that some talk about leaving the Union entirely.

And now — August 1814 — British troops are marching on the capital.

Washington is burning.

Chapter Two. The Burning.

My uncle was there. He told me what happened.

Our militia tried to stop the British at Bladensburg, just outside Washington. The soldiers broke and ran. The British marched into our capital unopposed.

They burned the Capitol building where Congress meets. They burned the White House. President Madison fled into the countryside. Dolley Madison grabbed a portrait of Washington and important documents before escaping.

The British were methodical about it. They burned government buildings but left homes alone. It was military destruction, not looting. Cold. Professional.

Uncle said the worst part was the silence afterward. "Our capital was empty. Just smoke and ruins. The most powerful country in the world had walked in and burned our government, and we couldn't stop them."

When the news reached Baltimore, I was ashamed. Furious. Terrified.

They were coming for us next.

Chapter Three. The Star-Spangled Banner.

September 13th, 1814. British ships anchored in the harbor, pointed at Fort McHenry.

All night they bombarded the fort. I watched from the city with everyone else — thousands of us on rooftops and hills, staring at the darkness. Rockets streaked red across the sky. Bombs exploded, lighting the smoke in flashes.

I couldn't see if the fort still stood. Nobody could. We just watched the explosions and prayed.

The bombardment went on for twenty-five hours. Twenty-five hours of wondering if our city would burn like Washington.

At dawn, the smoke started to clear. I held my breath.

And there it was. Our flag. Still flying over the fort.

I'm not ashamed to say I wept. Grown men were weeping all around me. We'd held. The British were retreating.

A lawyer named Francis Scott Key had watched the battle from a ship. He wrote a poem about it — about the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, and the flag still waving when morning came. People are already setting it to music.

Maybe someday everyone will know the words.

Chapter Four. The Irony of New Orleans.

The war ended in December 1814. A treaty signed in Belgium, of all places. The Treaty of Ghent, it's called. Nobody won. Nobody lost. Everything went back to how it was before.

But nobody in America knew the war was over.

News travels slowly. It takes weeks to cross the Atlantic. So in January 1815, Andrew Jackson was in New Orleans, defending the city against a British invasion.

On January 8th, British soldiers in perfect formation marched toward American lines. Jackson's men were behind cotton bales and earthworks, aiming their rifles.

It lasted thirty minutes.

Over two thousand British killed or wounded, including their general. Fewer than a hundred Americans fell. It was slaughter.

Jackson became a hero. The Battle of New Orleans proved Americans could beat British regulars in open battle. We celebrated for weeks.

Then we found out the war had already ended. Two weeks before the battle. All those men died fighting a war that was already over.

I don't know what to do with that. It's glorious and terrible at the same time.

Chapter Five. What the War Meant.

The Treaty of Ghent changed nothing. No territory swapped hands. No great concessions. We went to war and came back to exactly where we started.

So what was the point?

Father says the point was proving we could survive. We fought the most powerful empire on earth — again — and we're still here. Britain will never treat us as a minor nuisance again. We earned respect.

The war also killed the Federalist Party. While we were fighting, Federalists in New England held a convention at Hartford where some of them talked about leaving the Union. Then news arrived that we'd won at Baltimore and New Orleans. The Federalists looked like traitors who'd tried to break the country while everyone else was defending it. They never recovered.

Something else changed too. Before the war, people thought of themselves as Virginians first, or New Yorkers, or Georgians. The war gave us shared experiences. Shared heroes. Francis Scott Key's anthem. Andrew Jackson's victory. The humiliation of Washington and the redemption of Baltimore.

We started calling ourselves Americans like we meant it.

Chapter Six. The Flag Still Waves.

I go down to Fort McHenry sometimes. I look at the flag — not the same one from the battle, but a flag.

I think about that night. The rockets. The bombs. Not knowing if we'd survive.

I think about Washington burning. About the shame of it.

I think about Jackson at New Orleans, men dying for a war already over.

None of it makes complete sense. We accomplished nothing and everything at the same time. We lost battles and won the war. We started weak and ended proud.

Maybe that's what being American means. Muddling through. Making mistakes. Suffering defeats that should break us, and somehow coming out the other side.

The flag still waves. That's what Francis Scott Key wrote. Through the rockets and the bombs and the smoke, the flag still waves.

I was there when it happened. I saw the dawn. I saw the flag.

Whatever else happens, I'll remember that. The flag still waved. We're still here.

This concludes today's lesson. The War of 1812. Thank you for listening.
