Welcome to today's history lesson. The End of Reconstruction. Compromise of 1877.

You will hear this story from Samuel, age seventeen, Black voter in Mississippi, eighteen seventy-seven.

Chapter One. The North Loses Interest.

I'm Samuel, seventeen years old, and I live in Mississippi. I was born free in 1860. My early childhood was during slavery, though my family wasn't enslaved. I grew up during Reconstruction — watched its promise, now I'm watching its betrayal.

By the mid-1870s, the North doesn't care about us anymore.

In 1873, the economy collapsed. Banks failed. Businesses closed. People in the North have their own problems. They don't want to keep spending money on "the Negro question."

The Grant administration is drowning in scandals. Republicans look corrupt. Democrats are gaining ground.

And people are tired. The Civil War ended in 1865. It's been over ten years. White Northerners want to move on. They never really believed in equality anyway — they just opposed slavery. Now slavery's gone, the constitutional amendments passed. What more do we want?

What we want is for those amendments to mean something. But nobody's listening anymore.

Federal troops used to protect Black voters. Now there are fewer of them, and they rarely act when white supremacists attack us. The Freedmen's Bureau closed. We're on our own.

Chapter Two. Redemption.

White Democrats are taking back the South. They call it "redemption." What they mean is white supremacy.

In Mississippi, 1875, they have a plan. White militias — "Red Shirts," they call themselves — intimidate and murder Black voters.

I see it happen.

In September, I attend a Republican rally in Clinton. Armed white men attack. They murder dozens of Black people. The violence spreads across the state. Over three hundred Black people die in the months before the election.

Father is a Republican organizer. He goes into hiding. White militias search for him, promising to hang him if they find him. We hide him in the woods for weeks.

On election day, armed white men surround the polling places. They fire guns into the air. They threaten any Black person who tries to vote. In some areas, they force Black men to vote Democratic at gunpoint.

Democrats win. Of course they do. Mississippi is "redeemed."

We beg President Grant for help. He sends a weak response. He's politically damaged, facing Northern opposition to any more Southern intervention.

By 1876, only three Southern states still have Republican governments protected by federal troops. The rest have been "redeemed" through violence.

Chapter Three. The Disputed Election.

November 1876. Republican Rutherford Hayes against Democrat Samuel Tilden.

On election night, Tilden seems to have won. He has 184 electoral votes. He needs 185. Hayes has 165.

But twenty votes are disputed — from the three Southern states still under Republican control, plus one from Oregon. Both parties claim victory in those states. Democrats say they won legitimately. Republicans say Democrats won through fraud and murder.

Which is true.

If all twenty disputed votes go to Hayes, he wins. If even one goes to Tilden, Tilden becomes president.

The Constitution doesn't say what to do. The country faces a crisis.

Congress creates a special commission. It votes along party lines — 8 Republicans, 7 Democrats — and awards everything to Hayes.

Democrats threaten to refuse. Some talk about resuming the Civil War.

Then, in back rooms, a deal is made.

Chapter Four. The Bargain.

The Compromise of 1877.

Republicans agree to withdraw federal troops from the South. End Reconstruction. Stop protecting Black rights.

Democrats agree to accept Hayes as president and "respect" Black civil rights.

They're lying about the second part. Everyone knows it.

April 1877. President Hayes orders the last federal troops out of Louisiana and South Carolina.

I watch Union soldiers leave. They've been our protectors — the only force preventing complete white supremacist control. Now they're leaving.

It feels like betrayal. Soldiers who fought to free us, who protected our rights, abandoning us to the people who enslaved us.

Within days, Democrats take complete control.

They cut funding for Black schools. They pass laws to stop us from voting — poll taxes, literacy tests, "understanding" requirements. The laws look race-neutral but are designed to keep Black men from the polls.

They establish segregation. Separate facilities for Black and white. Separate schools. Separate railroad cars. Separate everything.

They call them "Jim Crow" laws, after a racist minstrel show character.

Father tries to vote in 1878. He's turned away. The registrar says he failed the "understanding" test — couldn't explain a section of the state constitution well enough.

The test is impossible to pass if the registrar doesn't want you to pass. White men aren't required to take it.

Father, who risked his life to vote during Reconstruction, is disenfranchised in his own country.

Chapter Five. What Was Lost.

By 1880, Reconstruction is dead. White supremacists control the South. Black people are segregated, disenfranchised, terrorized.

I try to understand what happened.

Reconstruction achieved so much. Ended slavery. Granted citizenship and voting rights. Built schools. For a moment, genuine multiracial democracy existed.

But it didn't give us land or economic independence. Without our own resources, we depended on white landowners. Sharecropping trapped us in poverty.

It didn't change white Southerners' belief in white supremacy. They used violence to restore racial hierarchy, and eventually the federal government decided our rights weren't worth the cost.

Most of all, white Northerners never really supported equality. They opposed slavery. But they didn't believe we were their equals. Once slavery ended, they lost interest.

The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments are still in the Constitution. But nobody enforces them. We're free in name only.

I'm seventeen. I'm watching everything my parents' generation fought for dismantled.

The struggle for freedom didn't end in 1877. It will continue for another century — longer. Not until the 1950s and 60s will the promises of Reconstruction be renewed.

We'll remember Reconstruction as an unfinished revolution. A glimpse of what America could be if it lived up to its ideals.

The fight continues. It always continues.

This concludes today's lesson. The End of Reconstruction. Thank you for listening.
