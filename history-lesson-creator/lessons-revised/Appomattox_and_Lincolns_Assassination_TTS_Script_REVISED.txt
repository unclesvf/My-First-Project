Welcome to today's history lesson. Appomattox and Lincoln's Assassination. War's End (1865).

You will hear this story from Daniel, age sixteen, Union soldier, eighteen sixty-five.

Chapter One. The Final Campaign.

I'm Daniel, sixteen years old, and I've been a soldier for two years. I enlisted after the Emancipation Proclamation. The war had become about ending slavery, and I wanted to be part of that.

By spring 1865, the end was coming. Grant had been hammering Lee's army for nearly a year — the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, then the siege of Petersburg. The fighting was brutal. At Cold Harbor, we lost seven thousand men in under an hour charging Confederate trenches.

Grant kept pressing. The Confederacy couldn't replace its losses. We could.

On April 2, we broke through Petersburg's defenses. Lee evacuated Richmond. The Confederate capital fell.

Lee retreated west, hoping to escape, to join other Confederate forces, to keep fighting somehow. We chased him. We marched hard, cutting off escape routes, surrounding him piece by piece.

April 9. Lee's army stumbled into a small Virginia town called Appomattox Court House. They were trapped. Maybe twenty-eight thousand exhausted, starving men against our hundred thousand.

Lee tried one last breakout at dawn. His cavalry charged our lines. For a moment, it looked like they might get through. Then our infantry arrived. There was no way out.

A Confederate officer rode out with a white flag.

It was over.

Chapter Two. The Surrender.

The officers chose a house belonging to a man named Wilmer McLean for the meeting. Strange coincidence — McLean used to live near Manassas, where the first Battle of Bull Run was fought. He'd moved to Appomattox to get away from the war. Now the war was ending in his parlor.

Grant arrived around one-thirty, muddy from hard riding. Lee was already there in his finest uniform. The contrast was striking — the Confederate commander immaculate in defeat, the Union commander travel-stained in victory.

They talked about old times. Both had served in the Mexican-American War years ago.

Then Grant offered terms. Confederate soldiers would surrender their weapons but keep their horses — they'd need them for spring planting. Officers could keep their sidearms. No one would be tried for treason. Everyone could go home, and as long as they obeyed the law, they wouldn't be bothered.

Lee asked if cavalrymen could keep their horses even though they weren't officers. Grant agreed. "Let them take the animals home to work their little farms."

Lee signed the surrender.

Four years of war. Six hundred twenty thousand dead. And it ended with two men in a parlor, one signing a piece of paper.

Chapter Three. The Armies Say Goodbye.

April 12. Confederate soldiers formally surrendered their weapons. I was there, part of the Union honor guard.

Twenty-eight thousand Confederates marched between lines of Union troops. They carried their battle flags — the flags they'd fought under at Chancellorsville, at Gettysburg, at a hundred other places. They stacked their rifles. They surrendered their flags.

Some of them cried. Others kept their faces hard, trying to hold onto dignity.

General Chamberlain, the hero of Little Round Top, commanded our troops. As the Confederates approached, he ordered us to carry arms — a salute of respect. The Confederate commander responded in kind.

We didn't cheer. Grant had forbidden it. "The war is over. The rebels are our countrymen again."

I talked with a Confederate soldier from North Carolina afterward. He was nineteen, had fought since the beginning.

"I'm going home to help my family," he said. "We lost. We lost slavery. Now we have to figure out what comes next."

We shared coffee. Yesterday we'd been trying to kill each other. Today we were just tired men, far from home.

Chapter Four. Good Friday.

April 14, 1865. Five days after Appomattox. Good Friday.

President Lincoln went to Ford's Theatre to see a comedy called "Our American Cousin." He'd earned some rest. Richmond had fallen. Lee had surrendered. The Union was preserved. The Thirteenth Amendment was making its way through the states.

At 10:15 p.m., John Wilkes Booth entered the presidential box. Booth was an actor, a Confederate sympathizer, and he hated Lincoln with a burning passion.

He shot Lincoln in the back of the head.

Booth jumped to the stage, shouting in Latin — "Thus always to tyrants!" — and escaped.

Doctors carried Lincoln to a house across the street. The bullet had entered his brain. There was no hope.

His cabinet gathered. His wife wept. He never woke up.

At 7:22 the next morning, Abraham Lincoln died.

Secretary Stanton said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

We'd been celebrating the war's end. Now we were mourning.

The man who'd saved the Union, freed the slaves, called for "malice toward none, charity for all" — killed just as peace arrived.

Chapter Five. What Was Lost.

Andrew Johnson became president. He was a Tennessee Democrat who'd stayed loyal to the Union. But he wasn't Lincoln.

Lincoln had been thinking hard about what came next — how to bring Southern states back, how to help four million freed people build new lives, how to heal wounds while demanding justice.

He'd watched Black soldiers fight and die for the Union. He was considering voting rights for Black men, at least those who'd served in the military or were educated. He wanted reconciliation, but real reconciliation — not pretending nothing had happened.

Johnson didn't care about any of that. He opposed slavery, but he also opposed equality. His Reconstruction would be lenient to Confederates and harsh to freed people.

I think about what might have been. If Lincoln had lived to guide Reconstruction. If his wisdom and his compassion had shaped what came next.

We'll never know. History doesn't show you the other paths.

At Appomattox, I watched former enemies shake hands and thought: maybe we can heal this. Maybe we can build something better from the wreckage.

Lincoln's death made that harder. Not impossible — but so much harder.

The war ended slavery. The war preserved the Union. But the war didn't answer whether freed people would truly be free, whether all men would truly be equal. That struggle was just beginning.

And Lincoln, who might have led us through it, was gone.

This concludes today's lesson. Appomattox and Lincoln's Assassination. Thank you for listening.
