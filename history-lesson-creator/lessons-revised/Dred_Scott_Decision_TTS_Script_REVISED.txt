Welcome to today's history lesson. Dred Scott Decision. The Supreme Court Fails (1857).

You will hear this story from Frederick, age sixteen, free Black in Pennsylvania, eighteen fifty-seven.

Chapter One. Hope.

I'm Frederick, sixteen years old, and I'm free. My father was born enslaved but bought his freedom, saved every penny, and moved us to Pennsylvania. We have our own home. Our own business. We're free.

Or so I thought.

We've been following the Dred Scott case for years. Dred Scott was enslaved in Missouri. His owner, an army doctor, took him to Illinois — a free state — and then to Wisconsin Territory, which is free under the Missouri Compromise. Scott lived in free territory for years. He married there. Had children there.

When they came back to Missouri, Scott sued for his freedom. He argued that living as a free man in free territory made him free. It seemed obvious. How can you be enslaved again after living free?

The case worked its way up through the courts until it reached the Supreme Court. We waited. We hoped.

We should have known better.

Chapter Two. No Rights.

March 6, 1857. The decision came down.

Father heard the news from a lawyer friend. He came home pale, his hands shaking.

"They ruled against him," Father said. "But that's not the worst part."

Chief Justice Taney wrote the opinion. He said Black people — enslaved or free — are not citizens of the United States. We cannot sue in federal court. We have no standing.

Then Father read me the words I will never forget:

Black people "had no rights which the white man was bound to respect."

No rights which the white man was bound to respect.

I am sixteen years old. I was born free in Pennsylvania. My father worked his whole life to build something for us. We pay taxes. We obey laws.

And the highest court in the land says we have no rights.

Mother cried. My little sister asked, "Does this mean we're not free anymore?" I couldn't answer her.

Father just sat there, jaw clenched, staring at nothing.

We're outsiders in the country where we were born. That's what the Supreme Court says. We don't belong here. We never did.

Chapter Three. What Else They Said.

It got worse.

Taney didn't just rule against Dred Scott. He declared the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional. The law that kept slavery out of the northern territories for thirty-seven years — gone.

His reasoning: slaves are property. The Constitution protects property. Congress can't take away someone's property just because they move to a territory. So Congress can't ban slavery anywhere.

Think about what that means. Slavery can spread everywhere. All the compromises, all the lines drawn on maps, all the bargains to keep the peace — unconstitutional. According to the Supreme Court, there's no legal way to stop slavery from going wherever slaveholders want to take it.

The Republican Party built their whole platform on stopping slavery's expansion. Now the Supreme Court says that platform is against the Constitution.

Some Southerners are celebrating. They say the Court finally recognized their rights. They're talking about bringing slavery into free states, about reopening the African slave trade.

In the North, people are furious. Newspapers call the decision corrupt, political, illegitimate. Republicans say they'll ignore it, appoint new justices, overturn it as soon as they can.

But for now, it's the law.

For now, I have no rights.

Chapter Four. What Do We Do Now?

Some free Black families are talking about leaving. Going to Canada. Going to Liberia. Giving up on America entirely.

I understand why. After the Fugitive Slave Law, we already lived in fear. Any Black person could be grabbed off the street, accused of being a runaway, dragged before a commissioner who gets paid more for sending people south than setting them free.

Now the Supreme Court says we're not citizens. We're not even fully human.

Father refuses to leave. "This is my country," he says. "I paid for my place here with sweat and blood. I won't let them drive me out."

I admire him. But I also wonder if he's wrong. If America doesn't want us, why stay?

I've read the Declaration of Independence. "All men are created equal." I've read the Constitution. "We the People." I used to think those words meant something. Now I think they only mean white people.

Maybe someday that will change. Maybe there will be a war, or an amendment, or something that forces America to live up to its promises. But right now, today, I'm a sixteen-year-old boy in a country that says I have no rights.

And I don't know what to do about it.

Chapter Five. The Path Forward.

Four years later — I'm twenty now — the Civil War begins.

I watch the country tear itself apart over the question the Supreme Court tried to settle. And I think: this is what happens when you try to end an argument by force instead of justice.

Taney thought his decision would solve the slavery problem. He thought if the Court just declared slavery constitutional everywhere, everyone would accept it and move on.

Instead, he made peace impossible. He told the North their entire moral position was illegal. He told the South they had constitutional protection for anything they wanted. There was no middle ground left.

Abraham Lincoln got elected in 1860 without winning a single Southern state. The South seceded. Now we're at war.

Dred Scott himself was freed shortly after the decision — his owner emancipated him. He died a free man in 1858, less than a year after the Supreme Court said he couldn't be free.

I think about Taney's words often. "No rights which the white man was bound to respect."

But you know what? He was wrong.

The war will end. The Constitution will be amended. Slavery will fall. And we will have rights — real rights, written into the Constitution, rights that even Chief Justice Taney's ghost will have to respect.

I don't know how long it will take. I don't know how many people will die. But I know this: you can't build a country on a lie forever. Sooner or later, the truth wins.

We are human beings. We deserve rights. And someday, America will have to admit it.

This concludes today's lesson. Dred Scott Decision. Thank you for listening.
