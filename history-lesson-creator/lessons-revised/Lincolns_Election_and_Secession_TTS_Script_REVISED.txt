Welcome to today's history lesson. Lincoln's Election and Secession. The Union Breaks (1860-1861).

You will hear this story from William, age fifteen, from South Carolina, eighteen sixty.

Chapter One. The Election of 1860.

I'm William, fifteen years old, from Charleston, South Carolina. The whole city is talking about the election. Father says what happens in November will decide whether we stay in the Union or leave it.

There are four candidates. The Democrats split — Northern Democrats want Stephen Douglas, Southern Democrats want John Breckinridge. There's a third party trying to avoid the slavery issue entirely. And then there's Abraham Lincoln, the Republican.

Republicans aren't even on the ballot in South Carolina. We couldn't vote for Lincoln if we wanted to. Which we don't.

Father calls him a "Black Republican," though Lincoln isn't actually radical about slavery. He just wants to stop it from spreading to new territories. But to Father and his friends, that's enough. If Lincoln wins, they say, it means the North controls the government permanently. It means slavery will slowly be strangled to death.

"We won't submit to rule by a sectional Northern party," Father says at dinner. "If Lincoln wins, South Carolina will secede."

I don't know what to think. All my life I've been told I'm American. I learned about Washington and Jefferson, the Constitution and the flag. Now Father says we might leave?

It's frightening. And, I admit, a little exciting.

Chapter Two. The Vote.

November 6, 1860. Results came by telegraph. Lincoln won.

He carried every Northern state. He didn't win a single Southern state — wasn't even on the ballot in most of them. He got forty percent of the popular vote, but enough electoral votes to win.

Charleston exploded. Church bells rang everywhere. Crowds filled the streets. But they weren't celebrating Lincoln — they were celebrating secession.

Palmetto flags went up across the city. Men wore blue cockades in their hats. Militia companies paraded through the streets while people cheered.

Father came home from a meeting with his face flushed. "The legislature has called a convention," he told Mother. "We'll vote on secession in December. It's happening."

Mother asked if there would be war. Father waved his hand. "Lincoln can't force us to stay. That would be tyranny. We have the right to leave peacefully."

But Mother looked worried. "What if he doesn't let us leave peacefully?"

"Then we'll defend ourselves."

I thought about Uncle Tom in Boston. Last time he visited, he and Father argued so fiercely they haven't spoken since. Uncle Tom said the North would never let the Union be dissolved. "You can't just leave when you lose an election," he said.

December 20, 1860. The convention voted. Unanimous: 169 to 0. South Carolina seceded from the United States.

I watched the crowd celebrate that night. We're not American anymore. We're... something else.

Chapter Three. The Confederacy.

Six more states followed us within weeks — Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas. In February, they all met in Montgomery, Alabama and formed a new country: the Confederate States of America.

They elected Jefferson Davis president and wrote a new constitution, similar to the old one but with one big difference: it explicitly protects slavery.

The Vice President, Alexander Stephens, gave a speech explaining what the Confederacy stood for. Father read it at dinner, nodding along.

Stephens said the United States was founded on the "false idea" that all men are created equal. The Confederacy, he said, is founded on the truth that "the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery is his natural condition."

Father approved. "Finally, someone telling the truth."

I felt uncomfortable but didn't say anything. My sister Sarah asked, "But Father, isn't slavery wrong? Reverend Thompson says all souls are equal before God."

Father's face hardened. "The Bible supports slavery. It's ordained by God and nature."

The conversation ended. But Sarah's question stayed with me.

We own three enslaved people. I've never thought much about it. But now we're building a whole country to protect slavery. I wonder if we're on the right side.

Chapter Four. Fort Sumter.

Fort Sumter sits on an island in Charleston Harbor. It belongs to the United States — or it did. Now it's inside Confederate territory, and Major Robert Anderson has about eighty soldiers holding it.

Lincoln took office in March. He said he won't invade the South, but he won't give up federal property either. He decided to send supplies to the fort — food, not weapons.

That put President Davis in a difficult position. If he lets Lincoln resupply the fort, he's accepting federal presence in our harbor. If he attacks, he starts a war.

April 12, 1861. Four-thirty in the morning. I woke to the sound of cannons.

I ran down to the battery with half of Charleston. We watched Confederate shells arc across the water toward Sumter. Explosions lit up the darkness. Buildings in the fort caught fire.

The bombardment lasted thirty-four hours. Somehow, nobody on either side was killed. On April 13, with the fort in ruins, Anderson surrendered.

I watched the American flag come down. The Confederate flag went up in its place.

Charleston celebrated like we'd won a great victory. Cannons fired salutes. People cheered and waved flags.

I cheered too. But part of me felt sick. We'd fired on the United States. On the flag I'd grown up saluting. There was no going back now.

Chapter Five. War.

April 15. Lincoln called for seventy-five thousand volunteers to put down the rebellion.

That changed everything. Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas — they'd refused to secede before. But they wouldn't send troops to fight other Southern states. Within weeks, all four joined the Confederacy.

Virginia was the big prize. The most populous Southern state, the wealthiest. Robert E. Lee, who'd been offered command of the Union army, resigned his commission instead. "I cannot raise my hand against my birthplace," he said.

My cousin James enlisted in a Charleston regiment. He's twenty years old, excited, certain we'll win quickly. "We'll whip them in three months," he said.

Father agreed. Mother didn't.

"The North has more people, more factories, more railroads," she told me quietly. "This won't be easy."

James marched away in his new gray uniform. Mother cried. I waved until I couldn't see him anymore.

I'm fifteen, too young to fight. Part of me is relieved. Another part feels guilty.

Two nations now, where there used to be one. We think we're fighting for independence, like the first Revolution. The North thinks they're fighting to save the Union.

I don't know who's right. I just know that the country I grew up in doesn't exist anymore. And whatever comes next is going to be terrible.

This concludes today's lesson. Lincoln's Election and Secession. Thank you for listening.
