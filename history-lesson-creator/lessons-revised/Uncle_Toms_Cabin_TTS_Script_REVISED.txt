Welcome to today's history lesson. Uncle Tom's Cabin. The Power of Literature (1852).

You will hear this story from Rebecca, age fourteen, Northern girl, eighteen fifty-two.

Chapter One. A Book That Changed Everything.

I'm Rebecca, fourteen years old, living in Boston. Everyone in my family is reading Uncle Tom's Cabin.

Mother bought it last month. She read passages aloud at dinner until Father insisted on reading it himself. My brother at Harvard says his classmates argue about it constantly. Even our minister preached a sermon about it.

I finally started last week. I couldn't put it down.

The story follows enslaved people in the South. Uncle Tom, sold away from his wife and children. Eliza, escaping across the frozen Ohio River with her baby, leaping from ice floe to ice floe while slave catchers chase her. Little Eva, a white child who befriends Tom and dies young. Simon Legree, who beats his slaves and eventually kills Tom.

Mrs. Stowe makes slavery not an abstract issue but a human tragedy. Families torn apart at auction. Mothers watching their children sold away. Men whipped for trying to learn to read.

When I finished, I cried. Mother cried. Even Father, who always said slavery was a Southern problem that didn't concern us, now calls it evil.

That's what this book does. It makes you feel it.

Chapter Two. Characters Who Feel Real.

Tom feels real to me. He's deeply religious, kind, noble. He's sold away from his family because his owner has debts. He could escape but doesn't because he gave his word.

He ends up owned by Simon Legree. Legree beats his slaves and works them until they collapse.

Legree orders Tom to whip another slave. Tom refuses. "I'd rather die than hurt someone."

Legree beats him for it. Tom forgives him. He maintains his faith even as he's dying. His death scene made me weep.

Eliza's story is different — she fights. When she learns her son will be sold, she runs. Slave catchers chase her to the Ohio River. The ice is breaking up, chunks floating in freezing water.

With her baby in her arms, Eliza jumps from ice floe to ice floe. She makes it to freedom.

These aren't principles. They're people. That's why the book is changing minds.

Chapter Three. The North Awakens.

Uncle Tom's Cabin is everywhere. Three hundred thousand copies sold in the first year. Only the Bible sells more.

People who never thought about slavery can't stop talking about it now. At school, girls debate whether Eliza's escape was realistic. At Father's office, men argue about what should be done. Ministers quote Mrs. Stowe from their pulpits.

The timing matters. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 requires Northerners to help catch escaped slaves. We've seen slave catchers in Boston, dragging Black people back to bondage while crowds protest.

Now Mrs. Stowe has shown us exactly what we're sending people back to.

My friend Sarah's father stopped buying Southern cotton after reading the book. "I won't profit from such evil," he said. My uncle, who avoided political talk his whole life, now attends abolitionist meetings.

Mrs. Stowe changed hearts. By making readers care about Tom and Eliza as human beings, she made slavery unbearable.

Chapter Four. Southern Fury.

The South is furious.

Southern newspapers call the book lies and slander. They say Mrs. Stowe never lived in the South and doesn't understand slavery.

Southern writers publish their own novels defending slavery — Aunt Phillis's Cabin, The Planter's Northern Bride. They claim enslaved people are happy and well-cared for, better off than Northern factory workers.

But their reaction proves the book's power. If it were just false propaganda, they could ignore it. Instead, they feel compelled to write elaborate defenses.

Some Southern states ban the book. Booksellers are threatened.

My cousin in Virginia stopped writing to me after I mentioned reading it. Her letter was angry: "Your Mrs. Stowe knows nothing of our ways. We treat our people well. Yankees should mind their own business."

We used to write weekly. Now we're silent.

The book has divided not just the nation but families.

Chapter Five. Words That Change the World.

It's extraordinary that a novel could have such impact.

Mrs. Stowe didn't write a political treatise. She wrote about people — their loves, losses, hopes, suffering. She made readers feel slavery in their hearts, not just understand it in their heads.

When I read about Tom being sold away from his wife and children, I thought of my own father. When I read about Eliza risking death to save her son, I thought of my mother.

Mrs. Stowe made slavery real by making it personal.

Years from now, when people ask what caused the Civil War, they'll point to many things. But they'll also point to this book.

I'm just a fourteen-year-old girl. I can't vote. I can't make laws. But I can read, and think, and talk about what I've read.

Mrs. Stowe showed me that changing hearts through truth and empathy can be as powerful as any political movement.

The slavery question won't be resolved easily. The South won't give up its "peculiar institution" just because Northerners read a novel. But Uncle Tom's Cabin has made compromise harder.

We can no longer pretend slavery is just a political issue. It's a moral issue. It demands choosing sides.

And the North is choosing freedom.

This concludes today's lesson. Uncle Tom's Cabin. Thank you for listening.
