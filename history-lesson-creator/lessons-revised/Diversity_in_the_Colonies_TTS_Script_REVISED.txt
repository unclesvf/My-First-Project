Welcome to today's history lesson. Diversity in the Colonies. The Middle Colonies: New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware (1664-1700).

You will hear this story from Maria, age fourteen, daughter of a Dutch merchant in New York, sixteen eighty.

Chapter One. From New Netherland to New York.

My name is Maria, and I am fourteen years old. I live in New York, though my parents still slip and call it New Amsterdam sometimes. Old habits.

We're Dutch. My parents remember when this was a Dutch colony, before I was born. In 1664, English ships sailed right into our harbor — four of them, bristling with guns. My father was just a boy, but he remembers Governor Stuyvesant stomping around on his wooden leg, ready to fight. The townspeople talked him out of it. Why get everyone killed for a war we'd lose anyway?

The English renamed everything. New Amsterdam became New York, after their Duke of York. Our whole colony got the same treatment. But here's the strange thing — they let us stay. Keep our houses, our language, our church. My family still speaks Dutch at dinner. We still celebrate Sint Nikolaas in December. Mother still makes oliebollen for New Year's, the smell of fried dough filling our whole house.

Walk down our street and you'll hear English, Dutch, French, German — and languages I can't even name, brought by sailors from places I'll never see. We have more churches than I can count: Dutch Reformed, English Anglican, Lutheran, even a synagogue for the Jews. Father says this is what makes us strong. I didn't understand that when I was little, but I'm starting to.

Chapter Two. Penn's Holy Experiment.

My uncle moved to Pennsylvania last year. He writes us letters full of wonder about the place.

Pennsylvania belongs to William Penn, a Quaker. The Quakers are... different. They believe everyone is equal before God — really equal, not just in words. Women can preach in their meetings. They won't swear oaths or fight in wars. Back in England, they get thrown in prison for these beliefs. Penn himself spent time in the Tower of London.

Somehow Penn convinced King Charles to give him a huge piece of land — payment for money the king owed Penn's dead father. Penn calls it a "holy experiment." He named his capital Philadelphia, which means "city of brotherly love" in Greek. I looked it up.

Here's what amazes my uncle most: Penn actually pays the Delaware Indians for their land. Pays them. Sits down with them, makes treaties, shakes hands. Everyone else just takes what they want and calls it God's will. Penn says violence is always wrong. I don't know if he's naive or brave or both.

Uncle writes that Pennsylvania is filling up with people from everywhere — German farmers, Welsh miners, Scotch-Irish who fought with everyone back home and want a fresh start. Like New York, but even more so. He says you can be whatever you want to be there.

I wonder what that feels like.

Chapter Three. Market Day.

Tuesday is market day at the dock, and I help Father at his stall.

The waterfront is chaos, but good chaos. Ships tie up and sailors spill out, shouting in languages that sound like music or gravel or birdsong. Some are sun-dark from the Caribbean, some pale from London. They all have money to spend.

At the stall next to us, Herr Müller sells dark rye bread that tastes nothing like what the English eat. Down the row, Mr. Henriques — he's Jewish, from Portugal originally — spreads out fabrics that shimmer in colors I don't have names for. Beyond him, a freedman named Samuel trades furs he got from trappers up north. He was enslaved once, Father says, but earned his freedom and built a business. He nods at me when I walk past, and I nod back.

Last week I went to a wedding. The bride was Dutch Reformed, like us. The groom was English and Anglican. Some old people muttered about it — mixing religions, mixing customs, what will become of their children? But most people just danced and ate and wished them well.

I think about what I hear from other colonies. In Massachusetts, they hang Quakers. In Virginia, you can only belong to one church. But here, on any given Sunday, I can count a dozen different bells ringing. Everyone worshiping their own way, all at the same time.

Father calls it our greatest achievement. I think I'm starting to agree.

Chapter Four. Questions About This Place.

I asked Father once why the Middle Colonies are so different.

He sat back and thought about it. "New England was built by one group with one idea," he said. "They want everyone to believe the same things. The South was built by men who wanted to get rich growing tobacco. They need slaves to do it, so they built their whole world around that."

"But us?"

"We were built by accident," he said. "The Dutch came for trade. The English took over but couldn't be bothered to change much. The Quakers came for peace. Germans came because their villages were destroyed by wars. Everyone came for different reasons. So nobody gets to be in charge of everyone else."

I think about that a lot. We're not as godly as New England wants to be. We're not as rich as the Southern planters. But we're free in a way they're not. Nobody tells me what to believe. Nobody checks whether I'm in the right church.

Father says we grow more wheat here than anywhere else in the colonies. They call us the "bread basket" because we feed half the Atlantic world. But I think the real thing we're growing is something else. A way of living together that nobody planned. It just happened, because we had no choice.

Chapter Five. The Price of Tolerance.

Not everyone thinks this mixing is good.

When a Catholic family moved onto our street, I heard the neighbors whispering. Papists. Spies for the Pope. Can't trust them. Mother told them to hush, but the new family keeps to themselves now. I see the daughter sometimes, about my age, and I want to say something. I never do.

Some ministers preach that tolerating false religions will bring God's punishment. "Better to be pure than prosperous," one of them said. But Father laughed at that. "Easy to say when you're not the one being purified out of your home."

And Penn's experiment isn't perfect either. Uncle writes that some English settlers are angry about his Indian treaties. They want that land. They don't want to pay for it. How long can Quaker principles survive when there's money at stake?

But I look around our market, our streets, our harbor full of ships from everywhere. I listen to all those languages, watch all those people buying and selling and arguing and laughing. And I think: this works. Not perfectly. Not easily. But it works.

Maybe that's the best any place can hope for. Not perfection. Just people figuring out how to live together, one market day at a time.

This concludes today's lesson. Diversity in the Colonies. Thank you for listening.
