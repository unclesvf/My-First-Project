Welcome to today's history lesson. The Great Awakening. Religious Revival in the Colonies (1730-1750).

You will hear this story from Sarah, age fourteen, daughter of a Connecticut farmer, seventeen forty-one.

Chapter One. The Traveling Preacher.

My name is Sarah, and I am fourteen years old. Today, something extraordinary happened in our small Connecticut town. A traveling preacher named George Whitefield came to speak.

We gathered in a field because no church could hold the crowd. Thousands of people came — farmers, merchants, servants, even enslaved people from nearby estates.

Our ministers usually read sermons in quiet, scholarly voices. Whitefield was different.

He preached with tears streaming down his face. His voice carried across the field like thunder. He spoke of sin and salvation, heaven and hell. He said it didn't matter if you were rich or poor, educated or ignorant — everyone needed to be "born again" through personal faith.

People around me began to weep. Some fell to their knees. Mother wept openly — I'd never seen that before. Even Father, usually so reserved, looked shaken.

Whitefield said we couldn't earn salvation through good works or church attendance. We needed a direct, personal experience of God's grace.

I didn't fully understand it. But I felt something change.

Chapter Two. Our Town Splits.

Whitefield's visit divided us.

Some people — "New Lights," they call them now — embraced this emotional, personal religion. They attend revival meetings, share testimonies of their conversion, and question whether ministers who haven't been "born again" should even preach.

Reverend Jonathan Edwards came from Northampton to preach at our meetinghouse. His sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" described hell so vividly that people clutched their pews in terror. Some fainted.

But other ministers — the "Old Lights" — condemn this emotional excess. They say religion should be orderly, rational, traditional. They accuse the revivalists of stirring up dangerous feelings.

My family split over this.

Father and Mother became New Lights, attending emotional prayer meetings. My uncle remained an Old Light, calling the revivals "dangerous enthusiasm."

At Sunday dinner, they argue. Religion from the head or the heart?

I listen, uncertain which path is right.

Chapter Three. Something New.

The Awakening is changing how people think about authority.

If ordinary people can have direct access to God without needing educated ministers, what else can be questioned?

New congregations form when people leave churches whose ministers they feel aren't truly converted. Before, you belonged to the church in your town. Now people choose their church based on conviction.

The revival crosses boundaries that used to be fixed.

Women speak publicly about their faith. Young people challenge elders. The educated elite no longer control religious life.

I saw this myself. An enslaved man named Samuel preached at a revival meeting. He spoke with such power about God's love for all people, regardless of their earthly station.

Some white people were scandalized. Others wept.

How can we claim all souls are equal before God while keeping some people in bondage?

The contradiction sits heavy in my chest. I don't have an answer.

Chapter Four. Seeds.

The Great Awakening is creating lasting changes.

New denominations form — Baptists and Methodists grow rapidly. New colleges will be founded to train revival-minded ministers. The emphasis on personal choice plants seeds of independent thinking.

Some ministers have begun preaching against slavery, though they're still a minority.

Most importantly, the Awakening teaches colonists to think for themselves. If established church leaders can be wrong about salvation, couldn't political leaders be wrong about governance?

I don't think this will cause a revolution. But it creates a mindset that values personal conviction over inherited authority.

That seems important, though I can't fully say why.

Chapter Five. Finding My Voice.

Three years have passed since Whitefield's visit. I'm seventeen now.

I joined a New Light congregation that meets in a barn — we left the established church. Here, I've found something remarkable.

My voice matters.

Last month, I spoke at our meeting about my faith. A woman — barely more than a girl — speaking about theology before the congregation! In the old church, only the minister spoke. Women sat silently.

Mother worries this makes me too bold. "Women should be modest and quiet," she reminds me.

But she herself attends these meetings where women pray aloud and share their experiences. The Awakening opened a door it cannot now close.

I see connections my uncle refuses to acknowledge.

If I can interpret Scripture for myself, why can't colonists interpret their political rights? If no minister has absolute authority over my soul, does any king have absolute authority over my freedom?

I don't know where this new spirit will lead America.

But I know we've changed. We've learned to think for ourselves.

That fire, once lit, won't easily be extinguished.

This concludes today's lesson. The Great Awakening. Thank you for listening.
