Welcome to today's history lesson. Lewis and Clark. Exploring the West (1804-1806).

You will hear this story from William, age seventeen, member of the Corps of Discovery, eighteen oh five.

Chapter One. Into the Unknown.

I'm William, seventeen years old, and I volunteered for what might be the stupidest or most glorious thing I'll ever do.

Captain Meriwether Lewis and Captain William Clark are leading about forty men up the Missouri River and beyond — all the way to the Pacific Ocean, if we can make it. President Jefferson wants us to map the new Louisiana Territory, find a water route to the Pacific, meet the Native peoples, study the plants and animals.

Nobody knows what's out there. Maps show blank spaces with guesses written in. "Mountains here?" "Great desert?" Nobody from the United States has ever crossed the continent.

We left Saint Louis in May of 1804. The Missouri River fights us every mile — sandbars, snags, currents that exhaust the strongest rowers. The heat is brutal. Mosquitoes come in clouds.

But the land is beautiful in ways I never imagined. Buffalo herds that darken the plains for miles. Birds I have no names for. A sky so big it makes me feel like I could fall into it.

Every night I write in my journal. Someday people will want to know what we saw.

Chapter Two. Sacagawea.

In North Dakota, we spent the winter with the Mandan people. Without them, we would have frozen or starved. They taught us how to hunt buffalo, how to survive the cold.

That's where we met Sacagawea.

She's about sixteen — my age, maybe younger. She's Shoshone, but she was kidnapped as a child and sold to a French trader named Charbonneau. Now she's his wife, and she carries their baby on her back.

The captains hired Charbonneau as an interpreter. But Sacagawea became more valuable than anyone expected.

Her presence tells every tribe we meet that we're not a war party. No one brings a young mother and infant to war. When we encounter new peoples, she speaks first. She identifies plants we can eat. She remembers trails from her childhood.

When we reached Shoshone country, we needed horses to cross the mountains. The Shoshone chief who could give us horses turned out to be her brother. She hadn't seen him since she was kidnapped years before. They held each other and wept.

We got our horses.

I think about what she's sacrificed. She's helping strangers cross her homeland, knowing more strangers will follow. Does she understand what we're opening the door to?

Chapter Three. The Mountains.

President Jefferson hoped we'd find an easy passage through the mountains — maybe a short portage between rivers, and then smooth sailing to the Pacific.

The Rocky Mountains laughed at that.

They go on forever. Ridge after ridge after ridge. Snow in September. Trails so narrow that horses slip and fall to their deaths. We ran out of food. We ate candles. We ate "portable soup" that tasted like leather boiled in despair.

I thought we would die in those mountains. Some of the men wanted to turn back. But Lewis and Clark kept pushing forward, and we followed because... I don't know why. Because we'd come too far to quit. Because giving up felt worse than dying.

We stumbled out of the mountains starving and desperate. The Nez Perce people found us. They could have left us to die. They could have killed us for our rifles and supplies.

Instead, they fed us. They nursed us back to health. They showed us the rivers that would carry us to the Pacific.

I will never forget that kindness. I wonder if they will regret it someday, when more Americans come.

Chapter Four. The Pacific.

November 7, 1805. Captain Clark wrote in his journal: "Ocean in view! O! the joy!"

The Pacific Ocean. We'd crossed the continent. Four thousand miles from Saint Louis. Plains and mountains and rivers and peoples Jefferson had never imagined.

We'd done it.

The winter at the coast was miserable — rain every day, everything rotting and moldy. But we'd reached the goal.

There's something I keep thinking about. When we needed to decide where to build our winter fort, the captains asked for a vote. Everyone voted. Every member of the expedition.

Including York.

York is Captain Clark's slave. He's been on this expedition from the beginning, hunting and working alongside the rest of us. Native tribes are fascinated by him — many have never seen a Black man before. He's been equal in every hardship, every danger, every decision.

He voted. An enslaved man voted on what we should do.

And then, when we get home, he'll still be enslaved. He'll still belong to Clark. He risked his life for this expedition, and nothing changes for him.

How do you explain that? I can't.

Chapter Five. What We Found.

We got back to Saint Louis in September 1806. We'd been gone twenty-eight months. Most people assumed we were dead.

We failed to find a water route to the Pacific. The mountains make that impossible. Jefferson's dream of easy passage died in the Rockies.

But we succeeded at something else. We mapped the way west. We documented rivers and mountains and plains. We met dozens of Native nations and learned about their territories. We brought back specimens of plants and animals unknown to science.

We proved Americans could cross the continent.

I'm proud of what we did. But I'm not innocent about what it means.

We weren't discovering anything. The Mandan, the Shoshone, the Nez Perce — they'd been living on and traveling through this land for thousands of years. They shared their knowledge and saved our lives.

What did we give them in return?

A map. A map that will guide American settlers, traders, and soldiers into their homelands. We were scouts for something that will swallow them whole.

Sacagawea helped us cross her own people's territory. Now more people like us will come, with guns and diseases and an endless hunger for land.

I don't know how to feel about it. The West is vast and beautiful and full of wonders. I'm glad I saw it. But I know what's coming, and I know we opened the door.

Captain Lewis struggled after we got back. He seemed lost, depressed. He died a few years later — they said he killed himself. I wonder if he saw the future more clearly than the rest of us. I wonder if it weighed on him.

The West we explored is already changing. It will never be again what it was when we passed through. For better or worse, we made sure of that.

This concludes today's lesson. Lewis and Clark. Thank you for listening.
