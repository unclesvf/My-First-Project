Welcome to today's history lesson. The Populist Movement. Farmers Organize (1890s).

You will hear this story from Emma, age sixteen, Kansas farm daughter, eighteen ninety-six.

Chapter One. Drowning in Debt.

I'm Emma, sixteen years old, and I live on a wheat farm in Kansas. My family works from sunrise to sunset planting, tending, and harvesting wheat. We work harder every year. Yet every year we sink deeper into debt.

The problem isn't laziness. We grow more wheat than ever. But the more we produce, the lower prices fall. Father says back in 1870, wheat sold for $1.50 a bushel. Now it's 50 cents. We grow three times as much and earn less money than before.

Meanwhile, everything costs more. The railroad charges whatever it wants to ship our crops — there's only one line through Kansas, so we have no choice. They give discounts to big companies but squeeze us dry. Banks charge terrible interest on loans. We borrowed money for equipment and seed, and now we owe more than the farm is worth. If we can't pay, they'll take our land.

Father sits at the kitchen table every night calculating what we owe. "We worked all year," he says, "and we're $200 deeper in debt." Mother cries quietly. My younger brother and sister don't understand why we work so hard yet have so little.

I don't understand either. We're the ones who grow the food. We're the ones who feed the country. Why are we the ones going broke?

Chapter Two. The Farmers' Alliance.

Farmers across the country are organizing. It started in Texas — something called the Farmers' Alliance — and now it's spreading everywhere. By 1890, Father says there are over a million members.

The Alliance holds meetings in schoolhouses and churches. Farmers come from all around to share their troubles and realize we all face the same problems: prices falling, railroads cheating us, banks crushing us with interest.

We try to fix things ourselves first. Farmers pool together to build grain elevators so we don't have to pay middlemen. We set up cooperative stores to buy supplies cheaper in bulk. Some folks try to negotiate with the railroads.

Most of it fails. The railroads won't budge. Banks refuse to lend money to our cooperatives. Big companies drop their prices just long enough to drive us out of business, then raise them again. Father comes home from meetings frustrated. "We can't beat them with money," he says. "They have all of it. We need political power."

So the Alliance starts pushing for laws. They want the government to control the railroads and grain elevators. They want a tax that makes rich people pay more. They want regular folks to vote for senators directly instead of letting state politicians pick them — because the corporations own the politicians.

But the thing farmers argue about most is silver. Right now, all our money is tied to gold, and there isn't enough gold to go around. Prices keep falling, which sounds good until you realize your debts stay the same size while your wheat is worth less and less. It's like trying to fill a bucket with a hole in it.

If the government started making money from silver too, there'd be more to go around. Prices would rise. Our debts would be easier to pay. The bankers hate this idea — they want money to stay scarce and valuable. But farmers are desperate for it.

Chapter Three. The People's Party.

In 1892, the Alliance does something nobody expected. They start their own political party: the People's Party. Some folks call it the Populist Party.

At the founding convention in Omaha, Nebraska, the speeches are angry. One man reads a preamble that calls out everything wrong with the country: corruption in government, stolen elections, a few millionaires getting rich while the rest of us turn into tramps.

The platform demands big changes. Free silver. Income tax on the wealthy. Government takeover of the railroads. Let people vote directly for senators. Eight-hour workday for factory workers.

Father comes home from a Populist meeting fired up. "We're the producing class," he tells me. "We grow the food, build the buildings, do the actual work. And we're being robbed by people who never lifted a shovel in their lives."

In 1892, the Populist candidate for president wins over a million votes. In Kansas, Populists actually win — we get a governor, we get congressmen. For the first time I can remember, farmers have a voice.

But the newspapers call us crazy. Radicals. Anarchists. Banks and railroads pour money into campaigns against us. In some places, elections get ugly — threats, fraud, violence.

Still, people are listening. That's what matters.

Chapter Four. The Cross of Gold.

1896 is the year everything comes to a head. This presidential election is about one question: gold or silver?

The Republicans pick William McKinley. He's for the gold standard, backed by every bank and corporation in the East. His campaign manager raises millions from wealthy men who want things to stay exactly as they are.

The Democrats are split until a young congressman from Nebraska named William Jennings Bryan gives a speech that changes everything.

I wasn't there, but Father was. He came home and couldn't stop talking about it. Bryan defended the farmers, attacked the bankers, and ended with his arms stretched out like he was being crucified:

"You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!"

The crowd went wild. Bryan won the Democratic nomination that night. Then the Populists decided to back him too. Finally — finally — we had a candidate who understood what we were going through.

The campaign was brutal. Bryan traveled everywhere, gave hundreds of speeches. McKinley stayed home and let the money do the talking. Father says the corporations outspent us ten to one, maybe more.

We worked so hard for Bryan. Mother and I made signs. Father drove neighbors to rallies. It felt like the most important thing we'd ever done.

Chapter Five. What We Lost, What We Kept.

McKinley won.

Father didn't say anything at dinner that night. None of us did. The cities and the factories voted for McKinley. The farms and the prairies voted for Bryan. And there are more people in the cities now.

"How do you beat that much money?" Father finally asked. "Banks, railroads, corporations — they bought the whole election."

The Populist Party fell apart after that. Some members joined the Democrats. Some gave up on politics entirely. The movement we'd built just... scattered.

But here's the strange thing. A lot of what we asked for actually happened, just not right away.

The income tax — that became law in 1913. Direct election of senators — same year. The government did start regulating the railroads more. Workers did eventually get the eight-hour day.

We didn't win, but we changed what people thought was possible. We proved that farmers and workers could organize, could challenge the money power, could demand that government serve regular people instead of just the rich.

I'm eighteen now. Our farm survived, barely. We're still in debt, still struggling. But I think about what Father said after the election, after he'd had time to think about it.

"The Populist Party failed," he told me. "But the Populist spirit — that doesn't die. Every time farmers organize, every time workers stand up together, every time ordinary people demand better — that's what we started. We planted seeds. They'll keep growing long after we're gone."

I hope he's right. I think he might be.

This concludes today's lesson. The Populist Movement. Thank you for listening.
