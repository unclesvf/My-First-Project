Welcome to today's history lesson. World War I. The Great War (1914-1918).

You will hear this story from James, age eighteen, American soldier in France, nineteen eighteen.

Chapter One. The Great War Begins.

I'm James, eighteen years old, and I'm an American soldier in France. The war has been raging since 1914 — four years of brutal fighting that has killed millions.

It started with an assassination. The Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary, shot dead in June 1914. Within weeks, the whole continent was at war. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Russia mobilized. Germany declared war on Russia and France. Britain came in to defend Belgium. The Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined Germany and Austria-Hungary. Italy, Japan, and eventually dozens of other countries joined Britain, France, and Russia.

The war froze into a stalemate almost immediately. On the Western Front — France and Belgium — both sides dug trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. For four years, millions of soldiers lived in those muddy ditches, launching attacks that gained a few yards at the cost of thousands of lives.

The weapons were horrifying. Machine guns cut down men attacking across open ground. Artillery bombardments destroyed everything. Poison gas — chlorine, phosgene, mustard gas — choked and blinded soldiers. Tanks, airplanes, submarines. Nothing like this had ever happened before.

President Wilson kept us out of it for three years. "Too proud to fight," he said. Most Americans agreed — this was Europe's mess, not ours.

But we kept getting pulled in. Germany's submarines attacked any ship headed for Britain, including American vessels. In 1915, a German U-boat sank the Lusitania — 1,198 dead, including 128 Americans. Germany backed off for a while, but in January 1917, they started again.

Then British intelligence intercepted something called the Zimmermann Telegram. Germany was proposing an alliance with Mexico. If Mexico attacked us, Germany would help them take back Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.

That did it. On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war.

Chapter Two. Over There.

"Over there, over there, Send the word, send the word over there, That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming..."

We sang that song constantly. We called ourselves "doughboys." We were confident, enthusiastic, and had no idea what we were walking into.

I enlisted in May 1917, trained for six months, shipped to France in November. The troopship was crowded and miserable. Guys got seasick. But we were excited. We thought war would be an adventure.

Arriving in France fixed that.

The trenches are hell on earth. Picture a muddy ditch, four feet wide, six feet deep. You live there for weeks. Rats everywhere — some as big as cats, fat from feeding on corpses. Lice in your clothes, your hair. When it rains, the trenches flood. We stand in water for days. Our feet swell and rot. They call it trench foot.

The smell is something I can't describe. Mud. Sweat. Latrines. Poison gas. And death — that sickly sweet smell of bodies rotting in no-man's-land, bodies we can't reach to bury.

The noise never stops. Artillery shakes the ground. Shells explode without warning. You learn to tell them apart — the whistle of incoming fire, different calibers of guns, the rattle of machine guns.

Going "over the top" — leaving the trench to attack — is the worst. Officers blow whistles. We climb ladders and run across no-man's-land toward enemy trenches. Machine guns open fire. Men fall. Artillery explodes around us. If you make it to the enemy trench, you fight with rifles, grenades, bayonets.

Attacks almost never work. We capture a few hundred yards and lose thousands of men. Then the enemy counter-attacks and takes it back. The front barely moves. The casualty lists get longer every day.

Chapter Three. The Tide Turns.

By spring 1918, Germany made a desperate push. They needed to win before American troops arrived in force. They broke through Allied lines. Advanced toward Paris. For weeks, nobody knew if they'd pull it off.

Then we showed up. Over two million American soldiers reached France by late 1918. We were green — didn't have the experience of British and French troops who'd been fighting four years. But we were fresh. We had numbers. We had energy.

The Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918 stopped the German advance. Americans fought hard. Then came the Hundred Days Offensive — attack after attack, August through November, pushing the Germans back.

I fought in the Meuse-Argonne. The largest American battle of the war. Over a million of us attacking German positions in eastern France. The fighting was brutal. In 47 days, 26,000 Americans died. 95,000 wounded. But we broke through.

By November, Germany was collapsing. Food riots at home. The navy mutinied. The Kaiser fled. On November 11, 1918, at 11 a.m. — the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month — the armistice took effect.

I was in the trenches when it happened. At 10:59, artillery was still firing. At 11:00 — silence. After four years of constant noise, the quiet was eerie. Men cried. Cheered. Prayed. We'd survived.

The cost was staggering. Over 9 million soldiers dead worldwide. 21 million wounded. An entire generation. 116,000 Americans dead. 204,000 wounded.

The "war to end all wars," Wilson called it. Standing in those trenches, seeing the devastation, I wanted desperately to believe him.

Chapter Four. Making Peace.

President Wilson went to Paris with big ideas. His Fourteen Points outlined how to build a lasting peace:

No secret treaties. Freedom of the seas. Free trade. Reduced weapons. Self-determination — letting nations govern themselves. And the biggest idea: a League of Nations, an international organization to prevent future wars.

The European leaders wanted something else. They wanted to punish Germany.

The French premier, Clemenceau, was especially harsh. France had been invaded. They'd lost a generation of young men. They wanted revenge. "America is far away, protected by the ocean," Clemenceau said. "We are next to Germany. We need security."

The Treaty of Versailles, signed June 1919, split the difference — mostly in Europe's favor.

Germany had to accept full blame for causing the war. Pay $33 billion in damages. Give up all colonies and 13% of their European territory. Limit their army to 100,000 men — no tanks, no aircraft, no submarines. They weren't even allowed to negotiate. They were handed the treaty and told to sign.

Wilson got his League of Nations included. He believed it would fix the treaty's problems over time, prevent future wars through cooperation.

But he still had to convince the Senate to accept it.

Chapter Five. Coming Home.

The Senate said no.

Wilson traveled the country trying to drum up support. Then he had a stroke that left him partially paralyzed. Without his leadership, the treaty died.

Many senators feared the League would drag us into foreign wars. Article X said members had to defend each other. That sounded like surrendering American independence to an international body. We'd just fought one war in Europe. We wanted to come home and mind our own business.

So America never joined the League of Nations — the organization Wilson created. Without us, it had no real power. Wilson's dream collapsed.

I came home to Nebraska in January 1919. Parades, celebrations. Everyone wanted to hear about our victory. But I felt disconnected. How do you explain what I saw to people who weren't there? Watching friends die. Living in mud. Going over the top knowing you might not come back.

Civilians celebrated. We remembered horror.

A lot of us struggled. Couldn't hold jobs. Drank to forget. We didn't have words like "PTSD" then, but we knew the war had changed us — inside, not just out.

America changed too. The government had expanded massively — drafted soldiers, controlled industries, restricted speech. Women worked in factories, gained independence. Black Americans moved north for industrial jobs. The war sped up changes already happening.

Looking back now, I see how it failed. It didn't end all wars. The harsh treaty created German resentment that someone like Hitler could exploit. The League couldn't stop anything without us. Millions died for territorial gains that lasted barely twenty years.

But the war also showed American power. We helped defeat Germany. We tried to build something better. We proved the oceans don't protect us from the world anymore.

I'm twenty-one now. A veteran. I survived when so many didn't. I saw the worst things humans can do to each other.

The war taught me peace doesn't happen by itself. It takes work. Wilson understood that. His League was humanity's hope to solve conflicts without slaughter.

We failed his vision. Another world war came. But after that one, we tried again — the United Nations. Maybe someday we'll learn.

For now, I'm home. Trying to build a normal life. Carrying memories I'll never escape.

The Great War is over. But for those of us who fought it, it never really ends.

This concludes today's lesson. World War I. Thank you for listening.
