Welcome to today's history lesson. The Mayflower Compact. Plymouth Colony and the Pilgrims (1620-1630).

You will hear this story from Elizabeth, age twelve, a Pilgrim aboard the Mayflower, sixteen twenty.

Chapter One. Why We Left.

My name is Elizabeth, and I am twelve years old. My family are Separatists — we broke away from the Church of England because we believe it's corrupt. In England, this made us criminals.

We lived in Holland for years, where we could worship freely. But my parents worried I was becoming more Dutch than English. When the Virginia Company offered us land in America, we decided to go.

Not everyone on our ship is Separatist. We call ourselves "Saints." We call the others "Strangers" — people coming for land and opportunity, not religion. There's tension between us.

The voyage was terrible. Sixty-six days crammed below deck. Dark, damp, the ship rolling constantly. People sick everywhere. Two died. One baby was born — they named him Oceanus because he was born at sea.

I spent most of the voyage praying we'd arrive safely. By the end, I was praying we'd just arrive.

Chapter Two. The Compact.

When we sighted land, something was wrong. We were far north of Virginia — outside the Virginia Company's territory. No legal government here. No laws binding us.

Some of the Strangers said they'd do as they pleased. Nobody could tell them what to do.

Our leaders saw danger. Without agreement, we'd tear ourselves apart before winter killed us.

So before anyone left the ship, forty-one men gathered in the Mayflower's cabin. My father was among them. They wrote and signed an agreement — the Mayflower Compact.

They promised to form a government and obey laws made "for the general good of the colony." They would create "just and equal laws."

Women couldn't sign. Servants couldn't sign. But still — they were creating their own government. Not because a king commanded it, but because they agreed to it.

William Bradford became our governor. The Compact became our foundation.

Father said it was the most important thing we did. More important than the houses we'd build or the crops we'd plant. We agreed to govern ourselves.

Chapter Three. The First Winter.

We arrived in November. Too late to plant anything. We had to build shelter before winter truly hit.

The men worked desperately in the cold, building a common house, then small homes. Progress was agonizingly slow.

Then the sickness came.

Scurvy. Pneumonia. Something else we couldn't name. People died almost every day. I helped care for the sick, though I was just a child. I held their hands. I brought water. I watched them slip away.

By spring, half of us were dead. Fifty people. My mother among them.

I watched Father dig her grave in frozen ground. We buried our dead at night so the native people wouldn't see how weak we'd become.

Only four or five women survived. My aunt became my mother now.

Many times I wished we'd stayed in Holland. Even if it meant being less English. At least we'd have been alive.

Chapter Four. Squanto.

In March, a miracle.

A native man walked into our settlement and spoke to us in English. English! His name was Samoset. He brought us to meet Massasoit, the Wampanoag leader.

Massasoit brought Squanto. Squanto's story broke my heart. English traders had kidnapped him years before, taken him to Europe. He finally made it home — and found his entire village dead from disease. Everyone he knew. Gone.

He was the last of his people.

Despite everything the English had done to him, Squanto helped us.

He taught us to plant corn using fish as fertilizer. He showed us where to find clams. Which plants to eat. How to tap maple trees. Without him, we would have died that second year.

We made peace with Massasoit. It lasted over fifty years.

That autumn, after our first real harvest, we held a feast. Massasoit came with ninety of his men. Three days of eating and thanksgiving. Later people called it the First Thanksgiving. We just called it surviving.

Chapter Five. What We Built.

I am eighteen now. Plymouth is a real town. Sturdy houses. Productive fields. Ships bring new settlers every year. We're not just surviving — we're building something permanent.

Father says the Compact was our greatest achievement. We proved people could create their own government without a king telling them to. Other colonies are watching. Some are following our example.

But I can't forget what it cost. Mother's grave on the hillside, with fifty others from that first winter. Squanto, dead four years ago, still helping us when the fever took him.

And I see things that trouble me. English settlements pushing further inland. Taking more land. The Wampanoag helped us survive, but every year we grow stronger and they grow weaker.

I pray this won't end in bloodshed. I'm not sure my prayers will be answered.

We came seeking freedom to worship as we chose. We found it. But what freedom have we taken from others?

These questions haunt me, even as I give thanks that we're still here.

This concludes today's lesson. The Mayflower Compact. Thank you for listening.
