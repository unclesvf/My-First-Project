Welcome to today's history lesson. The Progressive Era. Reform Movements (1900-1920).

You will hear this story from Catherine, age fifteen, settlement house worker, nineteen ten.

Chapter One. Hull House and the Settlement Movement.

I'm Catherine, fifteen years old, and I volunteer at Hull House in Chicago. It's in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the city — Italian families on one block, Polish on another, Greeks, Russians, all crowded into these dark tenement buildings where you can hear every argument through the walls.

Hull House isn't like anything I'd seen before. Miss Addams — Jane Addams — started it back in 1889. She actually lives here, in the same neighborhood as the people she's trying to help. That shocked me at first. A woman from a wealthy family, choosing to live where the streets smell like garbage and the children play in alleys.

I teach English twice a week to immigrant women. Most of them work in factories, twelve hours a day, and still come to my class at night. There's a woman named Rosa who sews shirtwaists. Her fingers are scarred from the needles. She's learning English so she can read the signs at her daughter's school, so the teachers won't look down on her.

Miss Addams says we're not here to give charity. "Charity makes people feel small," she told me once. "We're here to change the system that keeps them poor." She's always going to Springfield or Washington, testifying about child labor, factory safety, women getting the vote. She makes me believe we can actually fix things.

Everyone's talking about reform these days. The newspapers are full of it — exposing corruption, demanding change. My father calls it the Progressive Era, like we're all marching toward something better. I hope he's right. When I look at the children in our kindergarten class, I have to believe he's right.

Chapter Two. The Muckrakers Expose Corruption.

I read Upton Sinclair's book last month. "The Jungle." I couldn't eat sausage for weeks.

He wrote about the meatpacking plants here in Chicago — not far from Hull House, actually. The things he described... workers falling into rendering vats and being ground up with the meat. Rats running over piles of meat on the floor. Diseased cattle being slaughtered and sold. I thought it must be exaggeration. Then I talked to a man at Hull House who worked in the stockyards. He said Sinclair didn't tell the half of it.

The whole country was outraged. Congress passed new laws — the Pure Food and Drug Act, meat inspection. Sinclair said something funny about it: "I aimed at the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach." He wanted people to care about the workers. Instead they cared about what was in their breakfast.

But that's how change happens, I'm learning. You expose the truth, and people can't ignore it anymore.

There's a woman named Ida Tarbell who spent years investigating Standard Oil — Mr. Rockefeller's company. She showed how he crushed his competitors, bribed politicians, built a monopoly through tactics that were basically criminal. My father read her articles out loud at dinner, getting angrier with each installment.

And Lincoln Steffens wrote about corrupt city governments, how the political machines trade favors for money. President Roosevelt called these journalists "muckrakers" — people who rake through the muck of society. He meant it as an insult, but they wear it as a badge of honor.

I want to write like that someday. Words that make people see what's been hidden. Words that force things to change.

Chapter Three. Theodore Roosevelt and the Square Deal.

I was ten years old when President McKinley was shot, and Mr. Roosevelt became president. I remember my mother saying, "That cowboy in the White House." She didn't mean it kindly.

But Roosevelt surprised everyone. He's loud and energetic — you should see the cartoons of him, all teeth and spectacles — but he actually fights for working people. He calls it the "Square Deal." Fair treatment for everyone, not just the rich.

Two years ago, the coal miners went on strike. My uncle is a miner in Pennsylvania, so we followed it closely. The mine owners refused to negotiate — just refused. Said the miners should be grateful for what they had. Winter was coming and there wasn't going to be enough coal to heat people's homes.

You know what Roosevelt did? He threatened to send in the Army — not to break the strike, but to seize the mines and run them himself. The owners backed down. My uncle got a small raise and shorter hours. Not much, but something. "First time a president ever took our side," he wrote to us.

Roosevelt also goes after the big trusts — the monopolies that control whole industries. He sued Northern Securities, the railroad trust, and won. People call him the "trust-buster." He says he's not against big business, just against businesses that cheat and crush competition.

And he loves the outdoors. He's setting aside millions of acres as national forests and parks. "For our children and grandchildren," he says. Miss Addams approves of that, though she wishes he cared as much about the children working in factories right now.

Chapter Four. Woodrow Wilson and the New Freedom.

President Wilson is different from Roosevelt. Quieter, more like a professor — which he was, at Princeton. He calls his program the "New Freedom."

Father tries to explain Wilson's reforms to me at dinner. Some of it goes over my head, honestly. There's a new law about banking — the Federal Reserve Act — that's supposed to prevent panics like the one in 1907, when banks failed and people lost everything. Father says it puts the government in charge of the money supply instead of leaving it to the big New York bankers. I'm not sure I understand it fully, but he seems relieved.

The income tax is new too. For the first time, the government taxes people based on how much they earn. The wealthy pay more than the poor. It seems fair to me, though some of the rich men Father knows are furious about it.

What I do understand is the Clayton Act. It says labor unions can't be treated like criminal conspiracies anymore. Workers can organize and strike without being arrested. The women I teach at Hull House — the ones who work in the factories — they wept when they heard. For the first time, the law is on their side.

We also get to vote for senators now, directly. Before, state legislatures chose them, which meant the railroad companies and trusts basically bought the seats. Now ordinary people decide. It feels like democracy is actually expanding, like we're becoming more of what we're supposed to be.

Chapter Five. The Progressive Legacy—Promise and Limits.

I'm twenty-five now, and I've spent a decade working for reform. The Nineteenth Amendment just passed — women can vote. I cried when I heard. All those marches, all those women arrested and force-fed in prison, and we finally won.

Looking back at what we've accomplished... pure food and drug laws, antitrust enforcement, conservation, worker protections, women's suffrage. We proved that when people organize and demand change, change happens. That's not nothing.

But I've also learned to see what we've left undone.

The colored people in this country — we've done almost nothing for them. Worse than nothing. President Wilson segregated the federal government. Colored clerks who'd worked alongside white clerks for years were suddenly separated, demoted, fired. When I asked Miss Addams about it, she looked tired. "We can only fight so many battles," she said. But that's not good enough, is it? How can we call ourselves Progressives when we ignore the worst injustice of all?

And Prohibition — we fought for that too, to protect families from drunken husbands, to clean up the saloons that corrupted politics. But now that it's passed, I have doubts. You can't make people moral by law. Already there's talk of bootleggers and speakeasies. I wonder if we've just created a new set of problems.

Still, I think about Rosa, the woman I taught English to all those years ago. Her daughter graduated from high school last spring. First in her family to do it. Rosa came to Hull House to tell me, and we held hands and didn't say anything for a while.

That's what progress looks like, I think. Not some grand transformation, but Rosa's daughter holding a diploma. One family at a time. One law at a time. One fight at a time.

Miss Addams told me once that every generation has to decide: will they accept the world as it is, or fight to make it better? The Progressives chose to fight. We didn't fix everything — not even close. But we proved that ordinary people, organized and determined, can change their country.

I have to believe the next generation will keep fighting. I have to believe they'll finish what we started.

This concludes today's lesson. The Progressive Era. Thank you for listening.
