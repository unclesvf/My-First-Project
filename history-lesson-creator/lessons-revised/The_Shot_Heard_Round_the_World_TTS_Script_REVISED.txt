Welcome to today's history lesson. The Shot Heard Round the World. Lexington and Concord (1775).

You will hear this story from Nathan, age seventeen, a Minuteman from Concord, Massachusetts, seventeen seventy-five.

Chapter One. The Midnight Ride.

My name is Nathan, and I am seventeen years old. I'm what they call a Minuteman — militia trained to be ready at a minute's notice. Tonight that minute has come.

Word arrived after dark: British soldiers are marching from Boston. Seven hundred of them. They're coming for our weapons, the guns and powder we've stockpiled in Concord. Maybe they're coming for Samuel Adams and John Hancock too — they're hiding in Lexington, and the British would love to hang them.

Paul Revere and William Dawes rode through the night spreading the alarm. "The Regulars are out!" I heard the shout from my window.

My hands shook as I grabbed my musket. Powder horn. Shot pouch. Mother was crying. She tried to hide it, but I saw. Father gripped my shoulder hard enough to hurt.

"Remember what you're fighting for," he said.

I nodded. I didn't trust my voice.

Now I'm walking to the town green with neighbors I've known my whole life. We're farmers. Blacksmiths. A schoolteacher. The cooper's son, who's fourteen and shouldn't be here but came anyway. None of us have fought a real battle before.

Dawn is coming. So are the British.

Chapter Two. Lexington Green.

I wasn't at Lexington. I heard what happened from men who were.

Captain John Parker lined up seventy militiamen on the green. Seventy men against seven hundred. You could hear the British coming — the tramp of boots, officers shouting, drums beating.

Parker told his men: "Stand your ground. Don't fire unless fired upon. But if they mean to have a war, let it begin here."

The British commander rode up and ordered them to disperse. The militia started backing away — what else could they do, outnumbered ten to one?

Then a shot.

Nobody knows who fired it. British or colonial, accident or intent — it doesn't matter anymore. More shots followed. The British fired volleys into the militia.

Eight men died on Lexington Green. Ten were wounded. One British soldier got a scratch on his leg.

It wasn't a battle. It was a slaughter.

The British marched on toward Concord, thinking that was the end of it.

They were wrong.

Chapter Three. The Bridge.

By the time the British reached Concord, we'd gathered hundreds of militiamen. I was on Punkatasset Hill, watching smoke rise from the town. They were burning our supplies.

Someone said, "Are we going to let them burn the town?"

We weren't.

We marched down toward the North Bridge. British soldiers waited on the other side. My mouth was dry. My heart beat so loud I thought everyone could hear it.

Major Buttrick gave the order: "Fire, fellow soldiers! For God's sake, fire!"

I pulled the trigger. The kick slammed my shoulder. Smoke everywhere. Shouts. More shots. British soldiers fell. So did two of our men.

The British ran.

We stood there, stunned. We'd faced British regulars and they ran from us.

The retreat back to Boston was chaos for them. We didn't fight in lines like European armies — we shot from behind stone walls, trees, barns, anywhere we could hide. All seventeen miles back to Boston. By nightfall, seventy-three British soldiers were dead, two hundred wounded or missing.

We lost forty-nine killed.

I fired my musket eleven times today. I don't know if I hit anyone. Part of me hopes I didn't. Part of me hopes I did.

Chapter Four. What Now?

It's been two days. I can't stop shaking.

I keep seeing the bridge. The smoke. The British soldier who fell near me, clutching his chest, looking surprised. He was young. My age, maybe.

Mother holds me like I'm a child again. Father doesn't say much. He just sits with me.

News is spreading everywhere. Militias are marching toward Boston from all over New England. Thousands of men. The British army is trapped in the city, surrounded.

We're at war. Real war. This morning we were British subjects arguing about taxes. Tonight we're rebels. If we lose, they'll hang us.

The Hutchinson family left yesterday. They're Loyalists — loyal to the King. We used to play together when we were children. Now they're going to Boston for British protection, and I'll probably never see them again.

How did we get here? How did neighbors become enemies?

Chapter Five. What It Means.

I sat with Father last night and asked him what we're really fighting for.

"Is it about taxes?"

"Partly."

"About representation?"

"Partly."

He was quiet for a long time. Then he said: "I think we're fighting because we've become something different without realizing it. We're not Englishmen anymore. We're Americans. And Americans can't be ruled by people who don't know us, don't listen to us, don't care what we think."

I thought about that. Then I said: "But we talk about liberty while people own slaves. We talk about rights while women can't vote. If we win — what kind of country are we making?"

Father didn't have an answer.

Neither do I.

I clean my musket and wait for whatever comes next. We've fired the shot that can't be unfired. We've crossed the bridge we can't uncross.

A poet might call it "the shot heard round the world." But right now it's just smoke and blood and questions I can't answer.

We're revolutionaries now. For better or worse. We'll find out which.

This concludes today's lesson. The Shot Heard Round the World. Thank you for listening.
