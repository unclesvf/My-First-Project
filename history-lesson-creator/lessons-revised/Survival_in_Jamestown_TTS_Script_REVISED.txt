Welcome to today's history lesson. Survival in Jamestown. The Struggles of the First Permanent English Colony (1607-1620).

You will hear this story from Samuel, age fourteen, an indentured servant in Jamestown, sixteen oh nine.

Chapter One. Arrival in Virginia.

My name is Samuel, and I am fourteen years old. I came to Virginia as an indentured servant — seven years of work in exchange for passage to the New World. Back in London, they told us Virginia was full of gold and opportunity. They lied.

When our ship sailed up the James River in the spring of 1609, I saw a shabby wooden fort surrounded by forest that went on forever. About two hundred people lived here, and they looked like ghosts — thin, pale, exhausted. The gentlemen who came with us wore fine clothes but couldn't swing an axe or plant a seed. They actually thought they'd just pick gold up off the ground, like the Spanish did in Mexico.

Captain John Smith kept us alive with one simple rule: "He who does not work, shall not eat." The gentlemen hated him for it. They'd never worked a day in their lives. But Smith knew the truth — we'd all die if we didn't work together.

Inside the fort walls there was a church, a storehouse, and rough little houses that let in the wind. Outside lived the Powhatan people. Their chief controlled this whole region. We needed them — for food, for knowledge of this strange land. Without them, we'd have been dead before winter.

Chapter Two. The Starving Time.

Then came the winter of 1609. We called it the Starving Time.

Captain Smith got hurt — a gunpowder accident — and sailed back to England. Without him, everything fell apart. The Powhatans stopped trading with us. They were tired of our endless demands, tired of watching us take and take. They surrounded the fort. We couldn't leave.

We ate the horses first. Then rats. Then mice. We boiled our leather boots and belts into a kind of jelly and choked it down. People died every day. Hunger. Sickness. Some just gave up and lay down and didn't get up again.

I survived by sneaking outside the walls at night, digging for roots in the frozen ground. Any sound made me freeze — if the Powhatans caught me, I was dead. But staying inside meant starving. So I dug.

I watched my friend Thomas waste away. His eyes sank into his skull. His ribs showed through his skin. He died holding my hand, asking for his mother. I couldn't even cry — I was too weak.

We started the winter with five hundred people. By spring, sixty of us were left.

In June, ships finally came. Lord De La Warr brought food and new colonists. We'd been packing up to abandon Jamestown — we were done, finished, ready to sail home to England. But those ships saved us. Saved the colony.

I still dream about that winter. I don't think I'll ever stop.

Chapter Three. Tobacco Saves the Colony.

A man named John Rolfe figured out how to grow tobacco that the English actually wanted to smoke. He'd been experimenting with seeds from the Caribbean, and finally got a variety that grew well here and tasted sweet.

Suddenly everyone went tobacco-mad. It was like we'd found gold after all — just green and leafy instead of yellow and shiny. People planted it everywhere. In their gardens, in the streets, anywhere they could stick a seed. Ships carried barrels and barrels of it back to England, and money poured in.

The work was brutal. Planting, weeding, topping, picking, drying — sunrise to sunset, day after day. My back ached constantly. My hands were raw and stained brown from the leaves. The Virginia Company shipped over more servants like me, poor boys and girls from England trading years of their lives for a chance at something better.

John Rolfe married Pocahontas — the chief's daughter, the one who supposedly saved Captain Smith years back. She became a Christian, took the name Rebecca, even sailed to England where people treated her like a princess. For a while, her marriage meant peace between us and the Powhatans.

I watched her leave for England. She looked like a fine English lady in her new clothes. But her eyes... I don't know. She looked lost to me.

Chapter Four. Something New, and Something Dark.

In 1619, the Virginia Company let us create something called the House of Burgesses. For the first time, we could elect men to make our own laws. Not the company in London, not some lord — us.

Only landowners could vote, and only men at that. But still. My master attended the first meeting. He came back talking about tobacco prices and land grants and relations with the Powhatans. It felt like we had some say in our own lives for once.

That same year, a Dutch ship showed up with about twenty Africans. They sold them as servants, like me — supposed to work a set number of years and then go free.

But I watched how the planters looked at them. Calculated-like. These Africans didn't have contracts. Nobody in England would come looking for them. Nobody would care how they were treated.

I finished my seven years next spring. I got my freedom dues — fifty acres, some tools, seed corn, two sets of clothes. I'm a free man now, or will be.

But those Africans... I don't think they'll ever be free. And that thought sits in my stomach like a stone.

Chapter Five. Freedom's Promise and Price.

I'm twenty-four now. I've got my own land, ten miles upriver from Jamestown. A little cabin I built myself. Tobacco fields that I work with my own hands, for my own profit.

Back in England, I was nobody. The son of nobody. I'd have been a servant my whole life. Here, I own land. I might even be able to vote someday, if I do well enough. Some former servants have gotten rich, even served in the House of Burgesses. In Virginia, a man can rise.

But I keep thinking about those Africans from the Dutch ship. More have arrived since. And I see how the planters treat them — worse than they treated me, and that's saying something. They're not talking about freedom dues or contracts. They're talking about owning people. Forever.

I walk my fields in the evening sometimes, when the light goes golden and the river sounds peaceful. We built something here. We survived when we should have died. We made a colony out of nothing but stubbornness and desperation.

But I wonder what we're really building. All this tobacco needs labor, more labor than indentured servants can provide. And if planters can own people — really own them, them and their children and their children's children — what kind of place will this become?

I'm free now. But I don't think everyone will be.

This concludes today's lesson. Survival in Jamestown. Thank you for listening.
