Welcome to today's history lesson. Women's Suffrage. Winning the Vote (1848-1920).

You will hear this story from Alice, age sixteen, suffragist, nineteen twenty.

Chapter One. Seneca Falls to Susan B. Anthony.

I'm Alice, sixteen years old, and today — August 26, 1920 — I watched my mother vote for the first time in her life. The Nineteenth Amendment has been ratified. Women have won the right to vote after 72 years of struggle.

The fight started before my grandmother was born. Seneca Falls, New York, 1848. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized the first women's rights convention. Three hundred people came. They issued something called the Declaration of Sentiments, written to echo the Declaration of Independence:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal."

The list of grievances went on and on. Women couldn't vote. Couldn't own property after marriage. Couldn't attend most colleges. Couldn't enter most professions. Had no legal rights to their own children. The convention demanded suffrage — the right to vote.

Even some supporters thought that was too radical. Voting? For women? But Stanton insisted. Without the vote, nothing else would follow.

Susan B. Anthony joined in 1851. She and Stanton became partners — traveling the country, giving speeches, organizing, petitioning. People threw rotten eggs at them. Newspapers called them unwomanly. Dangerous.

In 1872, Anthony actually voted — illegally — in Rochester, New York. She wanted to test whether the Fourteenth Amendment, which made "all persons" citizens, included women. She was arrested, tried, and fined. The judge wouldn't let her testify in her own defense. Because she was a woman.

She refused to pay the fine.

Anthony and Stanton spent decades fighting for a federal amendment. Neither of them lived to see it pass. Stanton died in 1902. Anthony in 1906. But they built something that outlasted them.

Chapter Two. Two Strategies.

By the time I was born, the suffrage movement had split in two. Same goal, different ideas about how to get there.

The National American Woman Suffrage Association — everyone calls it NAWSA — was led by Carrie Chapman Catt. They worked state by state, lobbying legislatures, building support slowly. Wyoming let women vote back in 1869. Then Colorado, Utah, Idaho. By 1914, fifteen states had women's suffrage. NAWSA believed success would spread. They stayed respectable, worked within the system, proved women could be trusted with political power.

Alice Paul took a different approach.

She'd been to England, where suffragists chained themselves to fences, smashed windows, went on hunger strikes. She founded the National Woman's Party in 1916 and brought those tactics here.

In January 1917, the NWP started picketing the White House — the first group ever to do it. Women called "Silent Sentinels" stood outside holding signs. "Mister President, How Long Must Women Wait for Liberty?"

Then America entered the war. The picketers kept going. People were furious. How could they protest during wartime? But the signs quoted President Wilson's own words about democracy and self-determination. If those principles mattered, why didn't they apply to American women?

Police arrested over two hundred picketers. In prison, they were beaten. Thrown in filthy cells. When they went on hunger strikes, guards held them down and forced tubes down their throats to pour liquid food into their stomachs.

Alice Paul herself was force-fed. She nearly died.

But the brutality backfired. People who'd been against the suffragists started to sympathize. Women who endured that kind of treatment for the right to vote — they seemed heroic, not radical.

Chapter Three. Wilson Changes His Mind.

President Wilson started out against us. Said it was a state issue, not federal. But things kept shifting.

During the war, women took over. We worked in factories, served as nurses, sold war bonds, ran farms while men were overseas fighting. We proved we could handle anything. If we could do all that, why couldn't we vote?

In January 1918, Wilson finally announced his support. He called suffrage a "war measure." How could America claim to fight for democracy abroad while denying it to half its citizens at home?

The House passed the amendment that same month, exactly two-thirds majority. The Senate took longer — more lobbying, more pressure. June 1919, they finally passed it.

Then ratification. Thirty-six states had to approve. Three-fourths of forty-eight. Suffragists organized everywhere. Anti-suffragists fought back, arguing women voting would destroy families, cause moral decay. In the South, they used racist arguments — said it would give Black women the vote.

State by state it went. By August 1920, thirty-five had ratified. Tennessee was the last one we needed. The legislature was deadlocked. One young representative, Harry Burn, planned to vote no.

Then his mother sent him a letter: "Be a good boy... and vote for suffrage."

He switched his vote. Tennessee ratified by one.

August 26, 1920. The Nineteenth Amendment became law. "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."

Chapter Four. The First Vote.

November 2, 1920. The first presidential election where women can vote everywhere.

Mother and I go to the polling place together. She's forty-five years old and has never once cast a ballot.

The place is crowded. Men who've voted their whole lives stand in line next to women voting for the first time. Some of the men are supportive. Others grumble. A few make rude comments. Mother ignores them.

When it's her turn, the poll worker hands her a ballot. Her hands shake a little. She's waited her entire adult life for this moment.

She marks it carefully. Drops it in the box.

"I voted," she says. There are tears in her eyes. "I actually voted."

That night we talk about the women who made it possible. Stanton, who demanded the vote when it seemed impossible. Anthony, who fought for fifty years and died before victory. Catt, who built the foundation state by state. Alice Paul, whose militant tactics forced action.

And millions of women whose names nobody remembers — who attended meetings, signed petitions, marched in parades, faced ridicule and violence. Women who believed in something and fought for it across generations.

Mother tells me about her mother — my grandmother — who went to suffrage meetings in the 1890s. She died in 1915, five years before we won.

"She would have been so happy to see this," Mother says quietly.

Chapter Five. What We Still Don't Have.

The celebration is joyful. But it's not complete.

Many Black women still can't vote. The Nineteenth Amendment says you can't deny the vote "on account of sex." But Southern states use the same tricks they use against Black men — poll taxes, literacy tests, threats, violence. Black women fought for suffrage too. Leaders like Mary Church Terrell and Ida B. Wells worked for both women's rights and civil rights. They won't be able to fully vote until the 1960s.

Native American women can't vote either, because Native Americans aren't citizens yet. That won't change until 1924.

In some states, poll taxes keep poor women of all races from voting. Those won't be abolished until 1964.

And winning the vote doesn't mean winning equality. Women still can't serve on juries in many states. We're paid less than men. Most professions are closed to us. Married women often can't own property or sign contracts without their husbands' permission.

The movement itself wasn't perfect. Many white suffragists pushed Black women aside. Some used ugly arguments — claimed educated white women deserved the vote more than "ignorant" Black men. They chose gender over race, sometimes working with racist politicians to win support.

Mother and I talk about all of it. "The vote is a tool," she says, "not the goal. The goal is full equality — economic, legal, social. We've won the tool. Now we use it."

I'm sixteen. I'm part of the first generation of American women who will grow up knowing we can vote. I won't take it for granted. I'll vote in every election. I'll use my voice.

The suffragists taught me that change takes sustained struggle. They fought for 72 years. Some gave their whole lives to something they didn't live to see succeed.

That kind of dedication — that's what it takes. Winning the vote is a milestone, not the destination. Our daughters and granddaughters will keep working toward what we started. The suffragists proved it's possible.

Now it's our turn.

This concludes today's lesson. Women's Suffrage. Thank you for listening.
