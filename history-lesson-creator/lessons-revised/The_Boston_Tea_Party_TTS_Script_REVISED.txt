Welcome to today's history lesson. The Boston Tea Party. Colonial Resistance Escalates (1773).

You will hear this story from Thomas, age fifteen, apprentice to a Boston carpenter, seventeen seventy-three.

Chapter One. The Tea Act.

My name is Thomas, and I am fifteen years old. I'm an apprentice carpenter in Boston. My hands are calloused from saws and planes, and most days I think about wood joints and measurements.

But tonight I'm thinking about tea.

Parliament passed the Tea Act, giving the East India Company a monopoly on selling tea in the colonies. The Company was nearly bankrupt, so Parliament decided to bail them out by forcing us to buy their tea — and pay the tax on it.

My master says it's a trick. "They're making the tea cheap," he explained, "so cheap that even with the tax, it costs less than smuggled Dutch tea. They think we'll buy it because it's a bargain. And if we buy it, we're admitting Parliament can tax us."

"It's just tea," I said.

He gave me a look that made me feel like a child. "It's never just tea. It's never just stamps. It's about whether we have rights or we don't. Once we give in on this, there's no limit to what they can do."

Three ships are sitting in Boston Harbor right now, loaded with tea. Governor Hutchinson won't let them leave until they unload. Samuel Adams and the Sons of Liberty won't let them unload. Nobody knows what happens next.

Tonight, we find out.

Chapter Two. The Destruction of the Tea.

December 16th, 1773. I'm at the Old South Meeting House, packed in with thousands of others. The air is thick with breath and anger. Samuel Adams is speaking — I can barely hear him over the crowd — and then he says something that makes everyone go quiet:

"This meeting can do nothing more to save the country."

That's the signal.

Outside, men are disguising themselves. Blankets, ragged clothes, faces darkened with coal dust or paint. They're supposed to look like Mohawk Indians. They don't, really — it's a thin disguise, more symbol than concealment. We're not Englishmen anymore, the costumes say. We're something else. Americans.

I join them. I don't tell my master. I just go.

We march to Griffin's Wharf — about a hundred and fifty of us. The ships sit there in the moonlight, loaded with tea. The crews don't resist. This isn't about them.

For three hours, we work. We haul chests up from the holds — they're heavy, forty-five pounds each, 342 of them. We split them open with hatchets. We dump the tea into the harbor.

The smell is overwhelming. Sharp and strange in the cold December air. I'm covered in tea dust. My arms ache. I've never felt more alive.

When we finish, we sweep the decks. We put everything back the way we found it, except for the tea. We didn't steal anything. We didn't hurt anyone. We just destroyed £10,000 worth of British cargo.

Walking home through the dark streets, I realize my hands are shaking. From cold, from exhaustion, from something else I can't name.

Chapter Three. The Intolerable Acts.

Britain's response came fast.

Parliament passed what we call the Intolerable Acts. Boston Harbor is closed — no ships in or out until we pay for the tea. Our charter is revoked; Britain now controls our government directly. British officials who commit crimes here get tried in England, where no colonial jury can convict them. And we have to house soldiers in our homes if they demand it.

The port closing is the worst. Boston lives on trade. Without ships, there's no work. My master has almost nothing for me to do — nobody's building anything when they can't afford food.

Britain wanted to make an example of us. Punish Boston so badly that the other colonies would be too scared to resist.

It backfired.

Instead of abandoning us, the other colonies sent help. Wagons arrived from Pennsylvania with wheat. Rice came from South Carolina. Money from New York. They understood what my master understood: if Britain could do this to Massachusetts, they could do it to anyone.

For the first time, we weren't thirteen separate colonies with our own problems. We were in this together.

Chapter Four. Something New.

September 1774. Delegates from twelve colonies — everyone but Georgia — met in Philadelphia. They called it the Continental Congress.

My master went to Boston's Committee of Correspondence meetings and came back with reports. "They're talking about a complete boycott," he said. "No British goods at all until the Intolerable Acts are repealed."

"Will it work?"

"I don't know. But here's what matters — they're acting together. All of them. That's never happened before."

I thought about that for days. We'd always been separate. Virginians thought New Englanders were religious fanatics. New Yorkers thought everyone else was provincial. We had different accents, different churches, different ways of doing things.

But when Britain attacked one of us, we all felt it.

The Congress formed something called the Continental Association to enforce the boycott. Local committees would publish the names of anyone who imported British goods. The social pressure was intense — nobody wanted to be labeled a traitor to American liberty.

My master said something I haven't forgotten: "A month ago, nobody would have called it 'American liberty.' It would have been 'Massachusetts liberty' or 'Virginia liberty.' Now it's American. We're becoming a people."

Chapter Five. What We Started.

I think about that night at Griffin's Wharf a lot.

It felt like a game while we were doing it. An adventure. Breaking open tea chests in the dark, feeling like we were part of something important.

But it wasn't a game. We destroyed a fortune in British property. We defied Parliament openly and publicly. We made it impossible for Britain to pretend we were still obedient subjects who just needed a little patience.

They had to respond. If they let us get away with it, their authority was meaningless. So they sent the Intolerable Acts. And we had to respond to that. And around and around it goes.

My master says we're heading toward independence. He doesn't say it loud, but he says it. A year ago that word would have sounded insane. Now it sounds... possible. Maybe inevitable.

We crossed a line that night. All of us who threw tea into the harbor, but also everyone who cheered, everyone who sent food to Boston during the blockade, everyone who joined a Committee of Correspondence or signed a non-importation agreement. We all crossed it together.

There's no going back to how things were. Britain won't forget. We won't forget either.

I'm fifteen years old, and I helped start something I don't fully understand. Something that's going to change everything.

I guess we'll find out what that means.

This concludes today's lesson. The Boston Tea Party. Thank you for listening.
