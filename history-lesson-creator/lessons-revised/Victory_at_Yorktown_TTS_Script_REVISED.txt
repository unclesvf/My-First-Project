Welcome to today's history lesson. Victory at Yorktown. Winning Independence (1781).

You will hear this story from Marcus, age sixteen, son of a freed Black soldier, seventeen eighty-one.

Chapter One. Six Years of Waiting.

I'm Marcus, sixteen years old. My father is a freed Black man fighting for American independence — he was promised his freedom in exchange for military service.

For six years, this war has dragged on. We've won some battles, lost others. The British control the South. Many Americans are exhausted, wondering if we'll ever win.

But General Washington has a plan.

British General Cornwallis moved his army to Yorktown, Virginia, on the Chesapeake Bay. He expects British ships to supply and support him.

Washington sees an opportunity. If the French fleet can block the bay, and we surround Yorktown by land, Cornwallis will be trapped.

Chapter Two. The Trap.

Washington marches south, coordinating with French General Rochambeau. The French fleet under Admiral de Grasse sails into Chesapeake Bay and defeats the British navy. The British escape route by sea is blocked.

American and French forces surround Yorktown by land.

Cornwallis is trapped.

For weeks, we bombard their positions. French artillery pounds them day and night. We dig trenches closer and closer to their walls. I watch my father and other soldiers storm British redoubts in night attacks.

The British are running out of food. Running out of ammunition. Running out of hope.

Cornwallis tries to escape across the York River, but a storm turns him back. Even nature seems to favor American independence.

Chapter Three. The Night Attack.

The siege lasts three weeks. Our artillery — American and French cannons in carefully dug trenches — pounds the British constantly. The sound is deafening. I help carry ammunition, my ears ringing.

We dig parallel trenches, each closer to British fortifications. Siege warfare. Slow, methodical, deadly. British guns fire back. Men die every day. But we keep advancing.

On October 14th, Father participates in a night assault on British Redoubt Number 10.

American troops, including Black soldiers like him, charge with bayonets fixed. They take the position in brutal hand-to-hand combat. The French capture Redoubt Number 9 at the same time.

With those positions in our hands, our guns can fire directly into Yorktown.

Cornwallis is desperate. On October 17th, a drummer boy and an officer appear with a white flag.

He's ready to surrender.

After six years, the end is finally in sight.

Chapter Four. The World Turned Upside Down.

October 19, 1781.

Over seven thousand British soldiers lay down their weapons. As they march out, their band plays "The World Turned Upside Down."

I watch with my father as redcoats stack their muskets. Some British soldiers are crying. American and French troops stand at attention. Washington sits on his horse, dignified.

My father stands straight and proud. A free man who helped win freedom for a nation.

The war isn't officially over — that will take two more years of negotiations. But Yorktown is the decisive blow. Britain will give up.

We've won.

The United States of America will be independent.

Chapter Five. What Victory Means.

As I watch the surrender, I think about what this means for different people.

For Washington and the army, it's vindication. Six years of sacrifice.

For the French, revenge against their British rivals.

For most Americans, the chance to govern themselves. No more kings.

But for my father and other Black soldiers, the meaning is complicated. Father fought for American freedom in exchange for his own. Many enslaved men were promised liberty for their service.

Some will receive it. Others will be betrayed — sent back to slavery despite everything they did.

I ask Father if America will live up to its promises. Liberty and equality for everyone.

He pauses, watching the British lay down their arms.

"We've proven we can fight for freedom," he says quietly. "Now we must fight to make that freedom real for everyone. The war for independence is won. But the struggle for true equality is just beginning."

The Declaration says all men are created equal. We haven't made that true yet. That's the next battle, and it will take longer than this war.

Still, today is for celebration.

The impossible has happened. Farmers and shopkeepers, French aristocrats and freed slaves, fighting together — they've created a new nation built on a radical idea.

That people can govern themselves.

The world has turned upside down. Nothing will ever be the same.

This concludes today's lesson. Victory at Yorktown. Thank you for listening.
