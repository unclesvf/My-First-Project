Welcome to today's history lesson. President Washington. First Administration (1789-1797).

You will hear this story from Eleanor, age fourteen, living in New York City, seventeen eighty-nine.

Chapter One. A New Government Begins.

I'm Eleanor, fourteen years old, and I saw something today that I'll tell my grandchildren about.

George Washington took the oath of office as our first President. It happened on the balcony of Federal Hall, right here in New York. The streets were so crowded I could barely see, but Father lifted me up and I watched Washington put his hand on the Bible.

He looked nervous. George Washington, the man who faced down the British army, looked nervous.

I understand why. Everything he does from now on will be the first time anyone's done it. How should a president act? How formal should he be? Should people bow to him or shake his hand? Can he be friends with congressmen or does he need to keep distance? 

There's no book for this. He's writing it as he goes.

He chose men for his cabinet who are brilliant but hate each other. Thomas Jefferson will be Secretary of State. Alexander Hamilton will run the Treasury. They agree on almost nothing. Father says watching them work together will be like watching two cats in a sack.

Chapter Two. Hamilton's Plan.

Alexander Hamilton is young — barely thirty — but he has big ideas. He wants the national government to take over all the debts from the Revolutionary War, even the ones states owe. He wants to create a national bank. He wants America to become a country of factories and commerce, like Britain.

Thomas Jefferson hates all of it.

I heard Father discussing it with his friends. Jefferson thinks Hamilton wants to turn us into everything we fought against — a nation run by bankers and merchants, where the rich control the government and ordinary farmers don't matter.

"We didn't fight a revolution to create American aristocrats," one of Father's friends said, slamming his cup on the table.

But Hamilton's supporters say we need a strong economy to survive. Without credit, without trade, without industry, we'll be a weak nation that European powers push around.

They argue about it in Congress. They argue about it in the newspapers. They argue about it at dinner parties. President Washington tries to keep the peace, but even he can't make Jefferson and Hamilton agree.

Two visions of what America should be. Both sides think they're right. Both sides think the other will destroy the country.

Chapter Three. Staying Out of It.

When France and Britain went to war, I thought we'd help France. They helped us win our independence. Lafayette fought alongside Washington. We owe them.

But Washington said no. He declared neutrality. We won't help either side.

People were furious. The Democratic-Republicans love France — they're having their own revolution, overthrowing kings, declaring the rights of man. The Federalists prefer Britain — they're our biggest trading partner, and the French Revolution is getting bloody and chaotic.

Father explained Washington's thinking to me. "We're a small, weak country," he said. "If we get pulled into a European war, we could lose everything we've built. Washington is buying us time to grow strong."

It made sense when he said it that way. But it didn't feel noble. It felt like abandoning friends.

Washington served eight years, then announced he wouldn't run again. He could have been president for life — people would have let him — but he chose to walk away.

In his farewell address, he warned us about two things: political parties that divide us, and foreign entanglements that drag us into other people's wars.

We didn't listen to either warning. But his choice to leave power peacefully — that became our most important tradition.

Chapter Four. The Whiskey Rebellion.

In 1794, farmers in western Pennsylvania started a rebellion.

Hamilton had put a tax on whiskey to help pay the war debts. But for frontier farmers, whiskey wasn't a luxury — it was how they turned their grain into something valuable enough to transport over the mountains. The tax hit them hard, and they saw it as the same tyranny we'd fought Britain over.

They attacked tax collectors. Burned buildings. Talked about marching on the capital.

This was the test. Could the new government enforce its own laws? Or would it collapse like the Articles of Confederation?

Washington's response shocked everyone. He personally led thirteen thousand militia troops to Pennsylvania. Thirteen thousand. The President himself, on horseback, leading an army against American citizens.

The rebels scattered before the troops arrived. A few were arrested. Washington pardoned most of them.

Father watched the troops march through New York. "That's the difference between Washington and a king," he said. "A king would have executed them all. Washington showed he could crush them — and then chose mercy. Strength without cruelty."

I'm still not sure how I feel about it. But I understand the message: the Constitution isn't just words. The government will enforce it. But it won't become a tyranny doing so.

Chapter Five. Walking Away.

Washington left office in 1797. I went to see his farewell parade.

He looked old. Eight years of presidency had aged him terribly. The weight of every decision — Hamilton and Jefferson fighting, the Whiskey Rebellion, staying neutral while old allies asked for help — all of it showed in his face.

But the crowds loved him. People were crying. Not just women — grown men, weeping openly.

Father lifted me up again, like he did at the inauguration. "Watch this," he said. "Watch what he's doing."

"He's leaving," I said.

"Exactly. He's leaving. He won the war, and they offered him a crown, and he said no. He served as president, and he could have stayed forever, and he's saying no again. Do you understand what that means?"

I watched Washington's carriage disappear down the street. I thought about kings who cling to power until they die. About generals who become dictators. About all the ways this could have gone wrong.

"It means we don't need kings," I said.

"It means we can govern ourselves," Father said. "Washington just proved it. The most powerful man in America handed power to someone else, peacefully, because that's how republics work. That's his greatest gift to us. Not winning the war. Not being president. Walking away."

I didn't fully understand it then. I think I'm starting to understand it now.

We're not ruled by great men. We rule ourselves. And even great men have to step aside when their time is done.

This concludes today's lesson. President Washington. Thank you for listening.
