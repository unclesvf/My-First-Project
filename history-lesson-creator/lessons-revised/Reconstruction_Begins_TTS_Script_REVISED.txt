Welcome to today's history lesson. Reconstruction Begins. Rebuilding the South (1865-1867).

You will hear this story from Marcus, age fifteen, freed slave in Georgia, eighteen sixty-five.

Chapter One. The Day of Jubilee.

I'm Marcus, fifteen years old, and I was born enslaved on a cotton plantation in Georgia. I've worked in the fields since I was seven. I've been whipped for picking too slowly. I watched my older sister sold away when I was ten. I've lived every day knowing I was property, not a person.

June 1865. The war is over. Union soldiers arrive at our plantation.

They gather all the enslaved people — about two hundred of us — in front of the big house. A Union officer reads from a paper: By order of the President of the United States, all persons held as slaves are declared free.

Free.

The word doesn't seem real.

Some people shout. Some fall to their knees. Old Samuel, who's been enslaved for sixty years, weeps into his hands. My mother grabs my hand so tight it hurts.

"We're free, Marcus," she whispers. "Free."

Master Harrison watches from the porch, his face red. He shouts that we're still his property, that the Union has no right to steal his slaves.

The officer ignores him. "You're free to go wherever you want. You don't have to stay here."

But where would we go?

We have no money. No land. Nothing except the clothes we're wearing. We don't even know where our family members who were sold away might be.

Freedom is wonderful. Freedom is terrifying.

What do we do now?

Chapter Two. The Freedmen's Bureau.

Most of us stay on the plantation at first. Not because we want to — because we have nowhere else to go.

The Union army sets up something called the Freedmen's Bureau to help people like us. Mother and I walk to town to find their office.

The agent is a young officer from Massachusetts. He's sympathetic, but overwhelmed. Thousands of freed people need help — food, shelter, work, education. The Bureau doesn't have enough of anything.

"We're providing rations," he says. "We're setting up schools. And we're helping negotiate labor contracts with landowners."

Labor contracts. That means we can work for former slaveholders, but as paid workers with written agreements. Both sides have to agree to the terms.

It sounds better than slavery.

When we get back to the plantation, Master Harrison offers us a contract. Five dollars a month plus rations and a cabin. We'd work dawn to dusk, same as before, with penalties for "idleness" or "disobedience."

Mother refuses to sign.

"I won't work for him anymore," she says. "Not for any wage."

We leave with nothing but our clothes. We walk to town, where the Bureau gives us temporary shelter. Mother finds work as a laundress. It doesn't pay much, but she's her own boss now.

The Bureau sets up a school. I enroll immediately.

Learning to read feels like true freedom. They used to whip people for reading on the plantation. Now I'm sitting in a classroom with a book in my hands, and no one can stop me.

Chapter Three. Forty Acres.

There's a rumor spreading: the government will give freed people land. Forty acres and a mule. Confiscated from Confederate plantations and given to us.

I meet a family who settled on one of the Sea Islands. The father's eyes shine when he talks about it.

"Forty acres," he says. "We own it. Our children will inherit it. We're free and we're landowners."

Then President Johnson takes it back.

He pardons the former Confederates. He returns their land — including land freed people have been farming for months. Federal troops force families off property they thought was theirs.

The father I met loses everything. All of them do.

"Forty acres and a mule" wasn't just land. It was acknowledgment. We built the South with unpaid labor for two hundred years. Giving us land said: you earned this. You deserve to own something.

Taking it away said: you're free, but you'll start with nothing.

Most freed people end up as sharecroppers. We work the land for a share of the crop — usually half. The landowner provides land, tools, and seed. We provide the labor.

In theory it could work. In practice, landowners cheat. They charge high prices for supplies. They keep unfair records. At the end of the year, somehow you always owe them money. You can't leave until you pay what you "owe."

Freedom without land isn't really freedom. It's survival.

Chapter Four. The Black Codes.

Fall 1865. Southern states start passing laws they call "Black Codes."

Georgia's code says freed people need written proof of employment. If you don't have a labor contract, you can be arrested for vagrancy and forced to work for whoever pays your fine.

It's slavery with a different name.

The codes say we can't own guns, can't serve on juries, can't testify against white people in court, can't vote. Harsher punishments for us than for whites who commit the same crimes.

I experience the codes personally.

Walking through town one evening, a white constable stops me. "Where's your proof of employment?"

I explain I'm enrolled in the Freedmen's Bureau school. I live with my mother, who works as a laundress.

"Not good enough," he says. He arrests me.

At the courthouse, they fine me ten dollars — two months' wages. I can't pay. The judge says I'll be hired out to whoever pays the fine.

A plantation owner pays it. Now I owe him ten dollars plus interest, to be worked off at five dollars per month.

I'm trapped.

The Freedmen's Bureau agent intervenes. After weeks of fighting, they release me. But thousands of other freed people aren't so lucky.

The Black Codes prove that former slaveholders still control Southern governments. They're using the law to put us back where we were — not legally enslaved, but not really free either.

Chapter Five. The Fight Begins.

By late 1865, it's clear that President Johnson's Reconstruction isn't working. He's pardoning Confederates, letting them vote and hold office, doing nothing about the Black Codes.

Republicans in Congress are furious. They fought a war to end slavery. Now former Confederate leaders are going back to Congress, and freed people have no protection.

Congress refuses to seat the Southern representatives Johnson approved. They form a committee to investigate what's really happening in the South.

The committee hears testimony from freed people about the codes, about violence, about the Ku Klux Klan — former Confederates who attack, whip, and murder freed people and white Republicans to keep us terrified.

Congress decides to take Reconstruction away from Johnson. They'll pass laws protecting our rights. They'll require Southern states to let Black men vote. They'll use the army to enforce it.

They call it "Radical Reconstruction." But there's nothing radical about it. We just want what freedom is supposed to mean — the right to vote, to testify in court, to be protected from violence. Basic things.

I'm sixteen now. I can read. I'm watching Congress and the President fight over what freedom means for people like me.

I've learned that hope isn't enough. You have to fight for it. Defend it. Never take it for granted.

The struggle for real freedom has just begun.

This concludes today's lesson. Reconstruction Begins. Thank you for listening.
