Welcome to today's history lesson. Radical Reconstruction. Congressional Control (1867-1870).

You will hear this story from Eliza, age sixteen, freed slave in South Carolina, eighteen sixty-eight.

Chapter One. Congress Takes Control.

I'm Eliza, sixteen years old, and I was born enslaved on a South Carolina plantation. I was freed when I was thirteen, when the war ended. The last three years have been chaos — freedom without resources, Black Codes restricting everything we do, President Johnson letting former Confederates back into power.

But in March 1867, everything changed. Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts over Johnson's veto. They took control.

The former Confederacy is now divided into five military districts, each run by a Union general. Southern states have to write new constitutions guaranteeing Black men the right to vote. They have to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, which makes us citizens. Only then can they rejoin the Union.

In South Carolina, General Sickles is in charge. He threw out the Black Codes. He protects our right to testify in court. For the first time in my life, the law protects me instead of threatening me.

But the most important thing: Black men can vote.

My father registered in 1867. He was almost fifty years old. He'd been enslaved his entire life. Now he has a voter registration certificate.

"I never thought I'd see this day," he said, showing it to me. He was crying. "Free and a citizen with the right to vote."

I'd never seen him cry before.

Chapter Two. The Constitutional Convention.

Early 1868. South Carolina holds a convention to write a new state constitution. Black men are delegates — a majority, actually. Seventy-six out of a hundred twenty-four.

Most of these men were enslaved two years ago. Now they're writing the laws.

I attend the opening session in Charleston. The hall is packed. Black delegates debate alongside white ones. They argue about education, about property rights, about voting.

Robert Smalls is there — he was enslaved, then became a war hero by capturing a Confederate ship and sailing it to the Union navy. Now he's helping write our constitution.

The constitution they produce establishes public schools for all children, Black and white. It protects civil rights. It gives Black men the vote.

White conservatives call it "Negro rule." They say the delegates are ignorant. But the constitution is sound. Voters ratify it overwhelmingly.

That year, South Carolina elects a new legislature. Eighty-seven Black legislators out of a hundred fifty-seven. It's the only state legislature in American history with a Black majority.

My father's friend Robert gets elected to the state House. He was a field hand his whole life. Now he makes laws.

"We're building a new South," he tells us. "One based on equality."

Chapter Three. Citizenship.

The changes aren't just in South Carolina. Congress is rewriting the Constitution itself.

The Fourteenth Amendment passes in 1868. It overturns Dred Scott. It says everyone born in the United States is a citizen. It guarantees equal protection under law.

The Fifteenth Amendment passes in 1870. It says the right to vote can't be denied because of race.

I watch my father vote for the first time. He wears his best clothes. He stands in line with other Black men, all of them treating it like the solemn duty it is.

White conservatives glare at them. But federal troops are there to protect the voters.

Father votes Republican — the party of Lincoln and emancipation.

That night, when the results come in, Republicans sweep the elections. Black men helped elect them. We're not just free. We're political participants with actual power.

That's what freedom should mean.

Chapter Four. Progress.

The years 1868 to 1870 are extraordinary.

Black men serve in the legislature, as sheriffs, as judges. Hiram Revels of Mississippi becomes the first Black U.S. Senator. Joseph Rainey of South Carolina becomes the first Black Representative. They prove we can govern.

The state builds schools. Before the war, teaching enslaved people to read was a crime. Now I sit in a classroom with a book in my hands.

Our teacher is a Black woman from the North who came south to teach us. She's patient when I struggle with words I've never seen before.

"Education is freedom," she says. "No one can take knowledge from you."

Black communities build churches, organizations, businesses. Father saves money working as a carpenter. He dreams of buying our own land someday.

The progress feels fragile. But it feels real.

Chapter Five. Terror.

White conservatives won't accept this new world. They turn to violence.

The Ku Klux Klan spreads across the South. White robes and hoods. Night riders. They attack Black people who assert their rights and white Republicans who support us.

In 1868, they murder my neighbor Samuel. He registered to vote. That was his crime.

They dragged him from his home at night, beat him, and hanged him from a tree. They left his body as a warning.

The message was clear: vote and die.

The violence gets worse before the 1868 election. They attack polling places. Burn churches. Murder voters. In some areas, they kill dozens.

Father still votes. But he's frightened. We all are.

"They want us afraid," he says. "If we surrender our rights out of fear, freedom means nothing."

Congress passes laws to stop the Klan. President Grant sends troops. Hundreds of Klan members are arrested. For a while, the violence decreases.

But Northern commitment to Reconstruction is wavering. The economy collapsed in 1873. White Northerners have their own problems now. They're losing interest in our problems.

I'm eighteen. Educated. Hopeful. But realistic.

We've made extraordinary progress. It's under siege. Everything we've gained depends on federal protection and Northern political will.

What happens when those fade?

This concludes today's lesson. Radical Reconstruction. Thank you for listening.
