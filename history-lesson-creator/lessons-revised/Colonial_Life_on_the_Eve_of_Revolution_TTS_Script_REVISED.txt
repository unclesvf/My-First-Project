Welcome to today's history lesson. Colonial Life on the Eve of Revolution. Society and Culture in 1763.

You will hear this story from Rachel, age fifteen, daughter of a Philadelphia printer, seventeen sixty-three.

Chapter One. Life in the City.

My name is Rachel, and I am fifteen years old. I live in Philadelphia — people say it's the biggest city in all the colonies, maybe twenty thousand people. I've never been anywhere else, so I'll take their word for it.

Father owns a printing shop on Market Street. Most girls wouldn't know a printing press from a butter churn, but Father taught me to set type when I was ten. He says minds don't have a sex, which is a strange thing for a man to believe. But I'm grateful.

Our shop is where I learn about the world. Men come in to order pamphlets and stay to argue about politics. They drink coffee and debate John Locke and natural rights and whether Parliament can be trusted. I listen while I work, arranging tiny metal letters into words that will become newspapers.

Philadelphia has everything — theaters, coffeehouses, libraries, a college. The streets are paved and lit with lamps at night. Ships crowd the harbor. You can hear German and Dutch and French just walking down the block.

But I also see the other Philadelphia. The servants who work years to pay off their passage. The enslaved people doing laundry and hauling cargo, even though Pennsylvania was founded by Quakers who talk about equality. We have all this freedom, and it doesn't apply to everyone.

That bothers me more than it used to.

Chapter Two. Learning and Ideas.

Father believes in education more than anything. He says the printing press changed the world because it let ordinary people read and think for themselves.

In New England, they have public schools — the Puritans want everyone reading the Bible. Here in the middle colonies, there are private academies if your family can afford them. Down south, rich planters hire tutors. Poor children mostly don't learn at all.

But books travel. Newspapers travel. Ideas don't care who your father is.

The men in Father's shop talk about Enlightenment philosophers the way other men talk about horses or crops. John Locke says governments get their power from the consent of the people, not from God. If that's true, kings aren't divine — they're just people who can be wrong like anyone else.

Benjamin Franklin comes to our shop sometimes. He started as a printer's apprentice and now he's one of the most famous men in the world. He flew a kite in a thunderstorm and proved lightning is electricity. He says common people can improve themselves through education and hard work.

That idea is dangerous, if you think about it. If ordinary people can think for themselves, can govern themselves — what do we need kings for at all?

I set type for pamphlets about this stuff. The words go out to people I'll never meet. Maybe some girl on a farm in Virginia is reading what I printed and thinking thoughts nobody told her to think.

That feels like power.

Chapter Three. Who We Are.

I asked Father once what makes us different from people in England.

He thought about it for a long time. Then he said: "We built this ourselves. Nobody gave it to us."

It's true. My grandparents came here with nothing. They carved farms out of wilderness, built towns from scratch. We don't have ancient castles or noble families or centuries of tradition. We have what we made.

And we're all mixed together. Germans next to English next to Welsh next to Dutch. Quakers and Presbyterians and Catholics and Jews, all in the same city. In England, everyone knows their place. Here, nobody's quite sure what the places even are.

Father gets newspapers from New England and Virginia. We read about what's happening there like it's happening to family. The colonies used to feel separate — Boston was as foreign as London. But lately there's something connecting us. Maybe it's the wars we've fought together. Maybe it's the way we all resent the same things.

I don't know what to call it. "American," maybe. Though nobody really uses that word yet. Not the way Father says it when he's excited about something.

Chapter Four. The Coming Storm.

Last week, news came that changed the mood in the shop.

The war with France is over, and Britain won. That's good, I thought. But Father looked worried.

Britain borrowed a fortune to fight that war. Now Parliament wants the colonies to help pay it back. They're planning new taxes. They're stationing soldiers here and expecting us to house and feed them.

Father says this violates our rights as British subjects. "We can only be taxed by our own representatives," he explained. "We don't have anyone in Parliament. So Parliament can't tax us."

"Can't they do whatever they want?" I asked. "They're Parliament."

"That's the question, Rachel. That's exactly the question."

At the coffeehouse, the arguments have gotten louder. Some men say we should accept whatever the King decides — we're still part of the empire. Others say rights are rights, and if Parliament can ignore them once, they'll ignore them forever.

I don't know who's right. But I notice people are talking differently. Less about England, more about here. Less about being British subjects, more about being... something else.

Whatever's coming, it's coming soon. I can feel it.

Chapter Five. Contradictions.

Today I set type for a pamphlet about natural rights. "All men are created equal," it says. They have rights nobody can take away — life, liberty, property.

I arranged the letters carefully, but I couldn't stop thinking: What about Toby?

Toby delivers paper to our shop. He's enslaved — owned by a merchant down the street. He's smart and kind and remembers everyone's name. And he's someone's property, like a chair or a horse.

How can all men be created equal if Toby isn't free?

I asked Father. He put down his work and looked at me seriously.

"The ideas are still forming," he said. "We're writing principles we haven't figured out how to live by yet. Maybe we're hypocrites. Or maybe we're planting seeds that will grow into something better than we are."

I think about that a lot. We talk about liberty while people are enslaved. We celebrate equality while women can't vote or own property. We value education but only for some people.

Maybe that's what it means to be at the beginning of something. You have ideas that are bigger than you are. You write down principles you can't live up to yet. And then you spend the rest of your life — maybe generations — trying to catch up to your own words.

I'm fifteen. I set type in a printing shop. But the words I print go out into the world and make things happen. Maybe that's the most American thing of all — believing that ordinary people, doing ordinary work, can change everything.

We'll see.

This concludes today's lesson. Colonial Life on the Eve of Revolution. Thank you for listening.
