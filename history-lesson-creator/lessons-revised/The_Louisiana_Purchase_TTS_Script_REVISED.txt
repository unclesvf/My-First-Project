Welcome to today's history lesson. The Louisiana Purchase. Doubling the Nation (1803).

You will hear this story from Marie, age fourteen, daughter of a French trader in New Orleans, eighteen oh three.

Chapter One. A Territory Changes Hands.

I'm Marie, fourteen years old, and my city is about to change hands. Again.

New Orleans has been French, then Spanish, then French again. Now, I hear, we're becoming American.

President Jefferson paid Napoleon fifteen million dollars for all of Louisiana — over eight hundred thousand square miles stretching from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains. I can't even picture how big that is. Father says it doubles the size of the United States.

Napoleon needed money for his wars in Europe. He was afraid Britain might take Louisiana anyway. So he sold it. Just like that. He sold us.

Nobody asked us what we wanted.

Chapter Two. Jefferson's Contradiction.

Father finds this all very amusing. He says Jefferson has a problem.

Jefferson believes in something called "strict construction." It means the federal government can only do things the Constitution specifically allows. Jefferson has spent years criticizing people who bend the Constitution to do whatever they want.

But the Constitution says nothing about buying land from other countries. Nothing. If Jefferson follows his own principles, the purchase might not even be legal.

"What will he do?" I asked Father.

Father smiled. "He'll buy it anyway. And then make up reasons why it's allowed."

That's exactly what happened. Jefferson approved the purchase and argued, not very convincingly, that the power to make treaties includes the power to buy territory.

His opponents laughed at him. "The great defender of principle," one of them wrote, "abandons principle the moment it's inconvenient."

Father just shrugged. "Would you rather he'd let France keep New Orleans out of principle? Sometimes principles have to bend."

I don't know if that's wisdom or an excuse.

Chapter Three. What It Means for New Orleans.

New Orleans is not like other American places. We're French. We speak French. We're Catholic. We have laws and customs that go back generations.

We also have something that makes Americans uncomfortable: free people of color. Black men and women who own property, run businesses, marry whom they choose. In most of America, you're either enslaved or you're white. We don't fit their categories.

Now American officials are arriving, looking at us like we're exotic animals in a menagerie. "How charming," they say, watching our festivals. "How... foreign."

They talk about teaching us "American ways." About bringing us "civilization." As if we haven't been civilized for a hundred years. As if our music and food and art and language are barbarism that needs correcting.

Father tries to be optimistic. "America is an idea, not an ethnicity," he says. "They'll have to expand their idea to include us."

I'm less sure. When I see how American officials look at our mixed communities, our different religion, our different language — I see people who want to change us, not accept us.

Chapter Four. The People No One Asked.

When the news came that America had purchased Louisiana, there were celebrations. Flags went up. Speeches were made.

But Father asked me a question I can't stop thinking about: "Purchased from whom?"

France sold us. But France didn't really own us. And France certainly didn't own the land beyond New Orleans — the plains and rivers and mountains where tens of thousands of Native people live.

The Osage. The Caddo. The Choctaw. Dozens of nations whose names I'm still learning. Father trades with some of them. They've lived on this land for thousands of years.

"They're furious," Father told me after a trading trip. "France had no right to sell their land. America has no right to buy it. How can you sell something you don't own?"

But Europeans have an answer for that. They call it "discovery" — if a European country plants a flag somewhere, they own it, regardless of who was there first. It's a convenient fiction. It lets them claim whole continents without the people living there having any say.

Jefferson talks about an "empire of liberty." But whose liberty? Not the Native nations. Not the enslaved people who'll be dragged into these new territories.

Chapter Five. What We've Bought.

The American flag flew over New Orleans for the first time yesterday. I watched it go up.

Eight hundred thousand square miles for three cents an acre. That's the bargain everyone celebrates. Land for farmers. Access to the Mississippi River. Room for the country to grow.

But I keep thinking about all the things that come with the land that nobody talks about.

The question of slavery. Will it spread into these new territories? The North and South already fight about it. Now there's a whole continent to fight over.

The Native peoples. What happens to them as American settlers flood west? I've heard the stories from back East — treaties broken, land stolen, nations destroyed.

The people like us, already here. Will we be accepted as Americans or remade into something we're not?

Jefferson bought land. But he also bought problems that will haunt this country for generations.

I'm fourteen years old, standing in a city that's changed hands three times in my lifetime. I don't know what being American will mean for us. Nobody does.

But I know this: you can't just buy a continent and expect everything to be simple. Land comes with people. People come with questions. And some questions don't have easy answers.

This concludes today's lesson. The Louisiana Purchase. Thank you for listening.
