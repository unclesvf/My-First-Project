Welcome to today's history lesson. The Mexican-American War. War and Territorial Gains (1846-1848).

You will hear this story from Miguel, age sixteen, American soldier, eighteen forty-seven.

Chapter One. War.

I'm Miguel, sixteen years old, a private in the U.S. Army fighting in Mexico. My family is from New Mexico — Spanish-speaking Catholics who've lived there for generations.

When Texas joined the Union and President Polk sent troops to the disputed border, war became inevitable. Mexico says the border is the Nueces River. America claims it's the Rio Grande, a hundred and fifty miles south.

Polk ordered General Taylor to occupy the disputed zone. When Mexican troops fired on American soldiers, Polk told Congress: "American blood has been shed on American soil."

War was declared in May 1846.

Many Americans call this Manifest Destiny — God's will for America to expand from sea to sea. Young men volunteer eagerly, seeing glory and adventure.

But not everyone supports the war. Abolitionists like Frederick Douglass call it a scheme to expand slavery. Congressman Abraham Lincoln questions whether American blood was really shed on American soil — he suspects Polk provoked this deliberately. Henry David Thoreau goes to jail rather than pay taxes supporting what he calls an unjust war.

I'm conflicted. I'm American, but my family is culturally Mexican. I fight alongside Anglo soldiers who call Mexicans "greasers" and talk about racial inferiority. They say we're bringing civilization to savages.

But Mexico City was a great capital when English colonists were starving at Jamestown. We're not saving Mexico. We're conquering it.

Chapter Two. The Campaigns.

The war has gone badly for Mexico from the start.

General Taylor captured Monterrey. General Scott landed at Veracruz and marched toward Mexico City, following the route Cortés took three centuries earlier.

The fighting is brutal.

At Churubusco, Mexican defenders — including the San Patricio Battalion, Irish-American deserters who switched sides — fought to the death rather than surrender.

At Chapultepec, teenage Mexican cadets chose to die defending their military academy. One wrapped himself in Mexico's flag and leapt to his death rather than let it be captured.

I was at Cerro Gordo. We flanked the Mexican army and routed them. I saw Mexican soldiers, boys my age, running in terror as our troops advanced with bayonets. Some begged for mercy in Spanish I understood but my commanding officer didn't.

The killing felt like murder, not war.

By September 1847, we captured Mexico City. General Scott raised the American flag over the National Palace.

Victory is complete. And completely unjust.

Chapter Three. The Price.

The war cost about thirteen thousand American lives — though most died of disease, not battle. Mexican casualties were far higher, including thousands of civilians.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo is being negotiated now. Rumors say Mexico will lose California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. About half their territory.

America will pay fifteen million dollars. Which sounds generous until you realize we're paying for land we took by force. It's like a thief offering to buy the wallet he just stole.

The treaty promises Mexicans in the ceded territories can keep their property and become citizens. But I don't trust these promises. I've seen how Americans treat Mexicans.

My family in New Mexico will become Americans overnight. They're worried. Will they be equal citizens or second-class subjects? Will their land grants be honored? Will their children speak Spanish or be forced to abandon it?

Becoming American doesn't feel like opportunity. It feels like occupation.

Chapter Four. The Slavery Question Returns.

The war's most dangerous consequence isn't in Mexico — it's in America.

We've gained over five hundred thousand square miles of new territory. Every inch reopens the question: will it be slave or free?

Even before the war ended, Congressman David Wilmot proposed banning slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico. The South exploded. They supported the war expecting to expand slavery. If new territories are all free, the North will dominate Congress forever.

The North, meanwhile, increasingly opposes slavery's expansion. The Free Soil Party forms with the slogan: "Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, Free Men."

California's gold rush makes this urgent. Thousands flood to California, enough for statehood almost immediately. But will it be slave or free? We need a new compromise, and quickly.

I see the future clearly: the land we've taken from Mexico will tear America apart. We couldn't solve the slavery question with Louisiana. We couldn't solve it with Texas. We won't solve it with California.

Eventually, we'll fight each other over the very territories we took from Mexico.

Chapter Five. Conquest Dressed as Destiny.

Looking back, I see this war as a dark chapter in American history.

We provoked a weaker neighbor. Conquered half their country. Took their land. We claimed Manifest Destiny and moral superiority while acting like any other conquering empire.

President Polk got everything he wanted — California, New Mexico, the Texas border. America gained ports on the Pacific, mineral wealth, fertile valleys. In practical terms, the war was a huge success.

But morally?

We attacked a weaker neighbor. Killed thousands to satisfy territorial ambitions. Broke Mexico as a nation — they'll struggle for generations, partly because we stripped away their richest provinces.

And we've poisoned ourselves. The territory we gained will intensify the slavery crisis. Within fifteen years, we'll be fighting a far bloodier war among ourselves over whether slavery can expand into these lands.

Ulysses S. Grant, who fought in Mexico, will later call this "one of the most unjust wars ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation."

I agree.

Standing in occupied Mexico City, watching American soldiers celebrate, I feel ashamed.

Manifest Destiny is just empire with a better name. We speak of freedom while conquering. We proclaim democracy while denying it to others. We invoke God's will to justify our greed.

We won Mexico's land. I wonder if we lost something of ourselves.

This concludes today's lesson. The Mexican-American War. Thank you for listening.
