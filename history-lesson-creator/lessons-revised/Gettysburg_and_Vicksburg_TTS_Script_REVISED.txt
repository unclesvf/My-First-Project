Welcome to today's history lesson. Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Turning Point (1863).

You will hear this story from Sarah, age fifteen, from Gettysburg, eighteen sixty-three.

Chapter One. Our Town Becomes a Battlefield.

I'm Sarah, fifteen years old, and I live in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It's a small town — twenty-four hundred people, ten roads meeting at the center. We have a seminary, a college, farms, shops. It's quiet here.

Or it was.

June brought rumors of Confederate invasion. Lee's army marching north through Maryland into Pennsylvania. Some families packed up and fled. Others stayed, hoping the war would pass us by.

June 30. Confederate soldiers appeared on the Chambersburg Pike, looking for supplies. Shoes, mostly. They didn't stay long.

They'd be back.

July 1. I woke to gunfire. Distant at first, then closer. Union and Confederate forces were converging on Gettysburg from every road. Our quiet town had become the center of everything.

Mother told me to stay in the cellar. Through the small window, I watched soldiers running through our streets. Artillery shells exploded. A house on the corner caught fire.

By afternoon, Union forces retreated through town toward Cemetery Hill. Confederates chased them, capturing thousands. Our house became a Confederate aid station. Wounded men filled every room.

I helped where I could. Brought water. Held hands. Tried not to look at the blood soaking into our carpets, or the surgeons amputating limbs on our kitchen table.

That night, more Union forces arrived. They dug in on the hills south of town — Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, two rocky hills called the Round Tops.

A hundred sixty thousand soldiers surrounded Gettysburg. Our little town, caught in the middle.

Chapter Two. The Second Day.

July 2. The fighting shifted south, toward the Round Tops. From our cellar, we heard artillery all day. The explosions shook the house.

Between bombardments, we heard rifles — thousands firing at once. And screaming. So much screaming.

A Union soldier stumbled into our cellar, bleeding from his arm. He told us Confederates were attacking Little Round Top. If they took that hill, they could destroy the whole Union line.

"Colonel Chamberlain is holding," he said. "But they're almost out of ammunition."

He didn't know what happened after that. Neither did we.

Later I learned that Chamberlain's men, out of bullets, fixed bayonets and charged downhill into the Confederates. It worked. Little Round Top held.

That evening, our cellar filled with wounded from both sides. Confederate boys and Union boys, lying side by side, too hurt to care which army they belonged to.

One Confederate soldier asked me to write a letter to his mother in Georgia. He couldn't have been older than seventeen.

"Tell her I was brave," he said. "Tell her I wasn't scared."

He died before dawn. I still have the letter I never sent.

Chapter Three. Pickett's Charge.

July 3. The third day.

At one o'clock, Confederate artillery opened fire. Over a hundred fifty cannons, all pointed at the Union center. The noise was unimaginable — two hours of constant explosions. Our house shook. Plaster fell from the ceiling. We huddled in the cellar and prayed.

Then the guns stopped. Silence.

From our window, I saw what happened next.

Fifteen thousand Confederate soldiers emerged from the woods on Seminary Ridge. They formed into lines, a mile wide, and began marching across the open fields toward Cemetery Ridge. Three-quarters of a mile of open ground.

They marched in perfect formation, like a parade. They looked magnificent.

They looked doomed.

Union artillery opened fire. Shells tore holes in the Confederate lines. The men closed ranks and kept marching. When they got close enough, Union infantry behind a stone wall opened fire.

The slaughter was horrible. Men fell by hundreds. Some reached the wall — they call it the High Water Mark now — and broke through for a few minutes of hand-to-hand fighting. Then Union reinforcements pushed them back.

The survivors stumbled back across the field, stepping over the bodies of their friends. Of the fifteen thousand who charged, fewer than half returned.

General Lee met them. "It's all my fault," he said.

Chapter Four. After.

July 4. Lee's army retreated. The battle was over.

Fifty-one thousand men killed, wounded, or missing in three days. Seven thousand dead horses rotting in the summer heat.

For weeks, we cared for the wounded. Mother and I tended dozens of soldiers in our home. Some recovered. Many didn't.

The graveyards filled up. We buried men in our garden.

The smell was unbearable — bodies, gangrene, burning horse carcasses. Workers came to bury the dead, but there were so many. It took weeks.

In November, President Lincoln came to dedicate a national cemetery. A famous speaker talked for two hours. Then Lincoln spoke for two minutes.

I was in the crowd. His words were simple:

"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

He said we were fighting so "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."

Two hundred seventy-two words. But they changed what the war meant. We weren't just fighting to keep the country together. We were fighting for what the country was supposed to be.

Gettysburg broke the Confederacy's offensive power. Lee would never invade the North again. The war would go on for two more years, but after Gettysburg, the South could only lose slowly.

Chapter Five. Vicksburg.

The same day Lee retreated from Gettysburg, something else happened a thousand miles away.

Vicksburg, Mississippi, surrendered to General Grant.

We heard about it days later through the newspapers. Father read the news aloud, and even through our exhaustion and grief, we understood how important it was.

Vicksburg sat on bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. As long as the Confederates held it, they controlled the river — they could move supplies and troops between east and west.

Grant had besieged the city for forty-seven days. Bombarded it constantly. The people inside dug caves to escape the shells. They ran out of food and ate horses, mules, rats.

On July 4, they surrendered. The Mississippi belonged to the Union. The Confederacy was cut in half.

President Lincoln said, "The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea."

Gettysburg and Vicksburg, both on July 4th. Before that day, the Confederacy might have won. After, the question was only how long they could hold on.

I think about that sometimes. How one day can change everything. How a battle in my backyard and a siege on a river I'll never see could turn the whole war.

I think about the Confederate boy who died in our cellar. About his mother in Georgia, still waiting for a letter that will never come.

The war would grind on for two more years. More men would die. More towns would be destroyed.

But here in Gettysburg, in July 1863, something broke. The tide turned. And whatever else happened, the Union would win.

I just wish it hadn't cost so much.

This concludes today's lesson. Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Thank you for listening.
