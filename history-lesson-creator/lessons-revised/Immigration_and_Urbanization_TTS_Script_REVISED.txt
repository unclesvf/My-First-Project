Welcome to today's history lesson. Immigration and Urbanization. The New Colossus (1880-1920).

You will hear this story from Giuseppe, age fourteen, Italian immigrant, eighteen ninety-two.

Chapter One. The Journey to America.

I'm Giuseppe, fourteen years old, from a small village in southern Italy. My family are peasant farmers who barely survive. The land is poor. Taxes are high. There's no future for us here. Father says America is different — there's work, opportunity, freedom. We're going to try our luck.

We traveled to Naples, then boarded a steamship bound for New York. The cheapest passage is in steerage, the bottom of the ship. We paid $30 per person, everything we had saved for years.

Steerage is horrible. Hundreds of us crammed into a dark, airless space. Bunk beds stacked three high. No privacy. The smell is awful — unwashed bodies, vomit from seasickness, the toilet overflow. We're packed so tightly that disease spreads easily. Several children die during the crossing and are buried at sea.

The crossing takes three weeks. We're fed barely edible food — watery soup, hard bread. I'm seasick the first week. Mother fears I'll die. But I survive, and eventually the ship's motion becomes bearable.

On deck, when we're allowed up for air, I meet other immigrants — Poles, Russians, Jews, Greeks. We're all fleeing poverty or persecution, seeking something better. We share stories, practice English phrases, dream about America.

Finally, one morning, we see it: the Statue of Liberty rising from New York Harbor. Father reads the inscription at Liberty's base, written by Emma Lazarus: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."

"That's us," Father says. "We're those huddled masses." Mother cries, partly from relief at surviving the journey, partly from fear of what comes next.

Chapter Two. Ellis Island—The Gateway.

The ship anchors in New York Harbor. First-class and second-class passengers disembark immediately — wealth means your documents are accepted without question. But we steerage passengers are transferred to ferries bound for Ellis Island.

Ellis Island is where we'll be inspected, questioned, and either admitted to America or sent back. I'm terrified. What if they don't let us in? We've spent everything to get here. There's no going back.

The Great Hall is enormous and crowded. Thousands of immigrants wait in long lines, speaking dozens of languages. Interpreters shout instructions. Children cry. Adults look anxious.

First, medical inspection. Doctors examine us quickly, checking eyes, ears, throats. They're looking for diseases — trachoma, tuberculosis, anything that would bar entry. Anyone who looks sick is marked with chalk and set aside. I'm terrified I'll be marked, but the doctor passes me without comment.

Then the questioning. An inspector asks Father: "Where are you from? How much money do you have? Do you have a job waiting? Can you read?"

Father answers carefully. We're from Italy. We have $25. Uncle Paolo wrote that he'd help Father find construction work. Yes, Father can read.

The inspector stamps our papers. We're admitted.

Some families aren't so lucky. A woman nearby is separated from her children because she has trachoma. She'll be sent back to Europe while her children stay in America with relatives. Her screams echo through the Great Hall. I can't stop thinking about her face.

Chapter Three. Life in the Tenements.

We take a ferry to Manhattan and make our way to the Lower East Side, where Uncle Paolo lives. Everyone calls this neighborhood "Little Italy" — thousands of Italian immigrants live here, speaking Italian, cooking Italian food, keeping our ways alive in this strange new land.

Uncle Paolo takes us to our new home: a tenement building. Our apartment is on the fourth floor — two rooms for our family of six. We share a toilet in the hallway with five other families. There's no running water inside. We fetch it from a hallway tap and carry it in buckets.

The rooms are dark. One small window faces an airshaft, a narrow gap between buildings. Almost no light gets in. In summer, the apartment is so hot I can barely breathe. In winter, we huddle around a small stove that barely keeps us warm.

We share the apartment with another family, the Russos, also from Italy. Privacy is impossible. We hear everything — neighbors above, below, next door. The building is crowded, loud, sometimes violent. Fights break out. Drunken men shout at night.

But it's not all bad. The neighborhood is alive. Italian grocery stores, bakeries, churches. People speak Italian on the streets. I can almost pretend I'm home, except everything else is different.

At dinner, Mother makes pasta with tomato sauce, bread, a little cheese. It reminds us of the village. Father eats quickly, exhausted from construction work. I tell him about my day in the factory, and he nods, too tired to respond.

This is our life in America: hard work, poverty, crowding. But we're together, we're safe, and we have hope.

Chapter Four. Becoming American.

I work in a factory twelve hours a day making shoes. I earn $5 a week, which I give to Father for rent and food. The work is boring and exhausting, but the foreman says I'm lucky — there are always more immigrants desperate for my job.

I'm learning English slowly. At work, I pick up phrases. On the street, I practice with shopkeepers. I want to sound American, to speak without an accent. But it's hard. My tongue doesn't make English sounds right.

At night school — when I'm not too tired — the teacher says we must become American, not Italian-American. "Speak English, not Italian. Learn American ways. You're Americans now."

But at home, we speak Italian. We celebrate our holidays, eat our food. Our culture is who we are. Can I be both? Italian and American? I don't know yet.

Some people hate us. They call us "wops" or "dagos." They say we're dirty, ignorant, taking jobs from real Americans. I've seen newspaper cartoons showing Italians as criminals. There's talk of closing the door to immigrants like us.

Father calls this "nativism" — people who think they're more American than we are, even though their own grandparents came from somewhere else.

It hurts, being unwanted in a country we've sacrificed everything to reach. But we don't quit. We work hard, save money, send my younger siblings to school. We're building something, even if nobody wants us here.

My little sister speaks English better than Italian now. She says she's American, just American. Father is proud but also sad. We're becoming something new, but losing parts of who we were. America doesn't just mix cultures together — it burns away pieces of what you brought.

Chapter Five. The New Colossus.

It's 1900 now. I'm twenty-two. I've lived in America eight years. I work as a skilled shoemaker, earning better wages. My English is fluent. I'm saving to bring my cousins from Italy.

America isn't what we imagined. It's harder, harsher, meaner than we hoped. We work long hours in bad conditions. Poverty follows us everywhere. The promise of opportunity is real, but grabbing it nearly breaks you.

Still, we've made progress. Father bought a small house in Brooklyn — not a tenement, an actual house with a yard. My youngest sister will attend college. That would have been impossible in Italy. We're building something here.

I think about the Statue of Liberty, that giant woman holding her torch over the harbor. I remember seeing her the first time, not understanding what she meant. Now I know. Emma Lazarus wrote the words at her feet:

"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

We are those huddled masses. America gave us a chance — not an easy chance, not always a fair one, but a chance. We grabbed it with both hands.

Millions of us came between 1880 and 1920 — over twenty million, mostly from Southern and Eastern Europe. Italians, Poles, Russians, Jews, Greeks. We changed the cities completely. New York, Chicago, Philadelphia — they're different places now because of us. We brought our food, our music, our churches, our ways of doing things.

The cities grew so fast I can barely believe it. New York went from three million people to over five million. Buildings going up everywhere — some of them so tall they scrape the sky. Subways running underground. The whole country is moving off the farms and into the cities. For the first time ever, more Americans live in cities than in the countryside.

We did that. Immigrants like me. We built the factories, dug the tunnels, laid the bricks. We're building modern America, whether the nativists like it or not.

But I wonder sometimes — will America keep its promise? Will the golden door stay open? Or will they slam it shut and pretend they were always here, that their families didn't come from somewhere else too?

I don't know the answer. I'm just one Italian kid who crossed an ocean looking for something better. But I found it, even if it wasn't what I expected. And that's worth something.

This concludes today's lesson. Immigration and Urbanization. Thank you for listening.
