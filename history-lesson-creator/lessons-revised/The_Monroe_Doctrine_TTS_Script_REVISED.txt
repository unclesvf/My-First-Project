Welcome to today's history lesson. The Monroe Doctrine. American Foreign Policy (1823).

You will hear this story from Clara, age fifteen, daughter of a State Department clerk, eighteen twenty-three.

Chapter One. Europe and the Americas.

I'm Clara, fifteen years old, and I've been reading my father's correspondence when he's not looking.

Father works at the State Department, and the letters crossing his desk tell a worrying story. Spain wants its American colonies back. Russia is pushing down the Pacific coast from Alaska. European monarchies — the "Holy Alliance" — want to crush republican governments everywhere.

Today President Monroe sent a message to Congress that Father says will change everything. He called it a "doctrine." The Americas are closed to future European colonization. We won't interfere in Europe, but Europe must stay out of the Western Hemisphere.

Father came home excited. "We just told the most powerful empires in the world to back off."

"Can we enforce that?"

He paused. "Britain's navy will help. They want Latin American trade for themselves."

So our bold declaration depends on someone else's self-interest. Still, we made the statement. We said the words. That counts for something.

Chapter Two. The Holy Alliance.

Father explained what we're really worried about.

After Napoleon was defeated, the European monarchies banded together. Russia, Prussia, Austria, France — they call themselves the Holy Alliance. Their mission is crushing republican and democratic movements wherever they appear.

They see governments like ours as dangerous examples. If common people can govern themselves in America, what stops common people in Europe from getting the same idea?

Latin America is full of new republics now — Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico. People inspired by our revolution, throwing off Spanish rule. The Holy Alliance wants to help Spain reconquer them, stamp out the republican virus before it spreads.

Britain doesn't care about republicanism, but they care about trade. They'd rather buy from independent Latin American countries than see Spanish mercantilism return. So Britain suggested a joint declaration with us against European intervention.

Secretary Adams said no. He didn't want America hiding behind British skirts. "It would be more dignified," he argued, "to state our principles ourselves than to follow in Britain's wake."

So we made our own declaration. Even if Britain's navy is quietly backing us up, the words are ours.

Chapter Three. What It Means.

I asked Father what the doctrine really means.

"It means the Western Hemisphere is our sphere of influence now."

"But we don't have an army that could fight France or Spain."

"No. But we're saying we're the dominant power here. Europe had its era. The Americas belong to the future."

I thought about that. We're declaring ourselves protector of a whole hemisphere. We're warning ancient empires to stay away.

That's bold for a nation that's only existed for forty years. That's either confidence or arrogance. Maybe both.

Father admits there's a gap between our ideals and our actions. We proclaim liberty for Latin America while enslaving people at home. We warn Europe against colonization while pushing Native peoples off their lands. We protect sovereignty while expanding our own territory.

"Does that make us hypocrites?" I asked.

"It makes us human," Father said. "We have principles we don't always live up to. But at least we have principles. At least we say freedom matters, even when we fail to deliver it."

I'm not sure that's enough. But I don't know how to argue with it either.

Chapter Four. The New Republics.

I've been reading about the revolutions in Latin America. Simón Bolívar, who freed much of South America from Spain. Miguel Hidalgo, who started Mexico's fight for independence.

They were inspired by us. By our revolution. By our Constitution. They thought we'd be their allies, their older brother in the family of republics.

But we're not offering alliances. Not offering troops. Just words — "stay away" to Europe, but no "we'll help" to Latin America.

Father says it's practical. We're too weak to fight European powers directly. We need Britain's navy to enforce anything. We can't make promises we can't keep.

But I wonder how it looks from their side. The great republic that inspired them, watching from a distance while they struggle. Claiming to protect them while offering nothing but words.

Maybe words matter more than I think. Maybe saying "the Americas are free" makes it more likely to be true. Or maybe words are just words, and we're drawing lines on a map with no ink in our pen.

Chapter Five. Claiming the Hemisphere.

What does it mean to "protect" a hemisphere?

Some people at Father's office talk about the doctrine like it's pure idealism — defending republican government against monarchical tyranny.

Others talk about it like it's strategy — keeping European competitors out so we can dominate the Americas ourselves.

I suspect it's both. We believe in liberty, and we also want power. We want to help new republics, and we also want to control what happens in our neighborhood.

"Protecting can become controlling," Father admitted one night. "Helping can become dominating. The doctrine today defends freedom. What will future presidents use it to justify?"

I thought about that. A hundred years from now, will Americans cite Monroe's doctrine to protect liberty? Or to excuse expansion? Or both?

The Western Hemisphere is ours now, or so we've declared. Whether that means freedom or empire — I think we haven't decided yet. Maybe we won't decide. Maybe we'll be both, depending on the situation, depending on who's in charge.

For now, we've drawn the line. Europe on one side, the Americas on the other. We're the ones who drew it. We're the ones who'll decide what it means.

I'm fifteen years old, reading letters I shouldn't be reading in my father's study. And I have a feeling this doctrine will matter for a very long time.

This concludes today's lesson. The Monroe Doctrine. Thank you for listening.
