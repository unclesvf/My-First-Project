Welcome to today's history lesson. Manifest Destiny. Westward Expansion (1840s).

You will hear this story from Samuel, age sixteen, on Oregon Trail, eighteen forty-six.

Chapter One. Oregon Trail.

I'm Samuel, sixteen years old, and I've been walking for six months.

We left Independence, Missouri in spring, everything we owned packed into a covered wagon. Two thousand miles to Oregon's Willamette Valley. Father said it would be hard. He didn't say how hard.

We wake before dawn and walk until dusk. Fifteen miles on a good day. Ten on a bad one.

Three people from our wagon train have died. Mrs. Henderson, cholera. Thomas Wyatt, drowned crossing a river. And a baby, born on the trail, lived only two days.

Mother keeps a tight grip on my little sister now. She's terrified.

The land is beautiful in a frightening way. Prairie grass that goes on forever. Buffalo herds so big they darken the horizon. Thunderstorms that make our wagon shake like a toy.

People back East talk about something called "Manifest Destiny." A journalist named O'Sullivan wrote that it's America's divine mission to spread across the continent from Atlantic to Pacific. God intends it, they say.

Walking through this vast land, I wonder if God intended us to bury Mrs. Henderson by the trail with nothing but a wooden marker.

Chapter Two. Whose Land?

The land isn't empty. That's the thing nobody talks about.

We've passed through the territories of tribes I'm only learning the names of — Pawnee, Sioux, Shoshone. They watch our wagon trains from the hills. Sometimes they trade with us. Sometimes they just watch.

We're crossing their homeland without asking. Hunting their buffalo. Using their water. Cutting their trees for firewood.

One day a Sioux man rode close to our wagon. He just looked at us for a long moment, then rode away. I wondered what he was thinking. Probably nothing good.

I asked Father about it. "We're taking their land, aren't we?"

He didn't answer right away. Finally he said: "America needs land for its growing population. We believe our way of life is better — farming, democracy, Christianity. But you're right to feel uncomfortable. Manifest Destiny gives us a noble-sounding reason for taking what belongs to others."

He paused. "History will judge whether we're heroes or thieves."

I think about that a lot, walking across land that belonged to someone else for thousands of years before we decided it was ours.

Chapter Three. Oregon Fever.

Why Oregon?

Father says the land is green and fertile. Rain instead of drought. Soil that will grow anything. Room for everyone.

Back in Missouri, farms were getting crowded. Prices were low. Debts were high. Oregon promised a fresh start — six hundred forty acres if you can farm it and improve it.

Other people in our wagon train came for different reasons. The Bakers wanted to escape the slavery question — Oregon banned it, so there's no debate about it there. The Millers lost their farm and had nowhere else to go. Old Mr. Patterson just wanted adventure before he died.

President Polk is pushing for all of Oregon, even the parts Britain claims. "54-40 or Fight!" people shout, meaning they want American territory to stretch all the way to Russian Alaska.

But Polk compromised with Britain at the forty-ninth parallel. We get the southern half of Oregon. Britain keeps the north.

Some people are angry we didn't get more. But Britain has the most powerful navy in the world. Father says fighting them over a line on a map would be foolish.

Polk won't compromise with Mexico, though. He wants California too, and he's willing to fight for it. I guess Manifest Destiny only compromises with people who can fight back.

Chapter Four. Reaching Oregon.

After six months, we made it.

The Willamette Valley is everything they promised — green, fertile, beautiful. Mountains in the distance. Rivers full of fish. We claimed our six hundred forty acres and started building.

It's hard work. Clearing land, building a cabin, planting crops. Our nearest neighbors are miles away. Mother cries sometimes when she thinks no one's watching. She misses home.

More wagon trains arrive every month. The valley is filling up with Americans. We're organizing a territorial government, writing laws, building towns.

Oregon banned slavery — most settlers are farmers who don't want to compete with slave labor. But Oregon also passed laws excluding free Black people from living here. We want freedom for ourselves. That doesn't mean freedom for everyone.

As I work our land, I think about the people who lived here before us. Their villages are abandoned now. Their fishing sites taken over. We call it progress.

I'm not sure what they call it.

Chapter Five. The Cost.

We did it. We crossed the continent and built a new life.

Father's farm is producing crops. We have a cabin, neighbors, the beginnings of a community. My little sister has other children to play with for the first time in months.

This is the promise of Manifest Destiny — land, opportunity, a fresh start.

But I keep thinking about everything we passed on the way here. The Native peoples watching us cross their homeland, knowing what's coming. The graves by the trail. The Mexican territories Polk is about to take by war.

Every new territory opens the same question: slave or free? Oregon chose free. Texas is slave. What about California when we take it? What about the Southwest? The Missouri Compromise divided the Louisiana Purchase, but that doesn't apply to these new lands. We'll have to fight that battle again.

I asked Father once if Manifest Destiny was from God or just something we told ourselves to feel better about taking things.

"Maybe both," he said. "People usually believe God wants whatever they want. That doesn't mean God isn't real. It just means we're good at fooling ourselves."

I look out at our Oregon farm, the land we crossed a continent to claim. I'm proud of what we've built. I'm grateful for the opportunity.

But I know this land had other owners before us. I know people died — on the trail, in the territories we're taking, in the wars we're starting.

Manifest Destiny is a beautiful phrase for something complicated. Something with blood in it.

Future generations will decide if it was worth the cost. I'm not sure I'll live long enough to know.

This concludes today's lesson. Manifest Destiny. Thank you for listening.
