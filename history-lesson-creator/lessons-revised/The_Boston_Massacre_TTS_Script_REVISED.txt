Welcome to today's history lesson. The Boston Massacre. Rising Tensions in Boston (1770).

You will hear this story from Abigail, age fourteen, daughter of a Boston shopkeeper, seventeen seventy.

Chapter One. Redcoats in Boston.

My name is Abigail, and I am fourteen years old. My father owns a shop on King Street, near the Custom House. For two years now, we've had British soldiers living among us — thousands of them in red coats, walking our streets like they own them.

They came after the riots over the Townshend taxes. Parliament decided Boston needed to be controlled. So now redcoats are everywhere — in the taverns, on the corners, watching us.

The worst part is they take our jobs. When they're off duty, they work for half what a Boston man would charge. Rope-makers, dock workers, craftsmen — they're all losing work to soldiers who don't need the money to survive. The fights started almost immediately. I've seen men beating each other bloody behind the warehouses.

Every day feels dangerous. I walk past soldiers who look at me like I'm the enemy. People I've known my whole life mutter about "lobsterbacks" and "bloody backs." My father tells me to keep my head down and stay out of trouble.

But trouble is everywhere in Boston now. It's just waiting for something to set it off.

Chapter Two. The Night of March 5.

I heard the shouting from my bedroom window.

A crowd had gathered around a British sentry at the Custom House — maybe fifty people at first, then more. They were throwing snowballs, chunks of ice, oyster shells, whatever they could grab. "Lobster!" they yelled. "Bloody back! Coward!"

More soldiers came running. Seven or eight of them, with muskets and bayonets. The crowd grew too — someone rang the fire bell, and people poured into the streets thinking something was burning.

I watched from our window, my mother gripping my shoulder so hard it hurt.

The crowd pressed closer. They were waving sticks and clubs. "Fire!" someone yelled. "You won't dare fire!" Others took up the chant, taunting them. The soldiers looked terrified — young men, barely older than me, surrounded by a screaming mob.

Then the guns went off.

It was fast and chaotic — I don't think anyone gave an order, not really. But shots cracked out, one after another, and people fell. I saw a man spin and drop. Another crawled away, leaving a red trail in the snow.

Five dead, when it was over. Crispus Attucks, Samuel Gray, James Caldwell, Samuel Maverick, Patrick Carr. I learned their names later. That night, they were just shapes in the snow, blood steaming in the cold air.

I couldn't stop shaking for hours.

Chapter Three. Two Stories.

Everyone has a story about what happened that night. The problem is, the stories don't match.

The patriots say it was cold-blooded murder. Unarmed colonists gunned down by brutal soldiers. Paul Revere made an engraving showing it that way — neat lines of redcoats firing into a peaceful crowd. That picture spread everywhere. People who weren't there believe it like gospel.

But I was there. I saw the crowd. They weren't peaceful. They were throwing things, screaming, pressing in with clubs. The soldiers looked scared out of their minds.

Does that make it right? I don't know. Five men are dead. That can't be right.

Here's what really surprised me: John Adams agreed to defend the soldiers at trial. John Adams — the patriot, the one who writes all those pamphlets against British tyranny. He said even redcoats deserve a fair trial and a proper defense.

Most of the soldiers were acquitted. Two were convicted of manslaughter — they branded their thumbs and let them go. A lot of people were furious about that.

But Mr. Adams said something I keep thinking about. He said facts are stubborn things. Whatever our wishes, we can't change what actually happened. The soldiers were attacked by a mob. They fired. Both things are true.

I wonder if that kind of thinking is going to survive what's coming.

Chapter Four. After the Blood.

The day after the shooting, thousands of people gathered on the Common. Some of them had guns. The message was clear: get the soldiers out of Boston, or this gets worse.

Acting Governor Hutchinson gave in. He ordered the regiments out to Castle Island in the harbor. They're still there, watching us across the water.

The funerals were something I'll never forget. Shops closed. Bells tolled all day. Thousands of people walked behind the coffins — rich and poor, black and white, all together. Crispus Attucks was part African, part Indian, and he was buried alongside the white victims. In death, they were equals.

My father closed our shop that day. He stood at the window for a long time, watching the procession.

"This won't be the end of it," he finally said. "We've been walking toward something like this for years. Now we've arrived. And I don't see any way to walk back."

I wanted to tell him he was wrong. I couldn't.

Chapter Five. What Stayed With Me.

Most of the Townshend taxes got repealed after that. All except tea — Britain kept that one, just to prove they could. The soldiers stayed on their island. Things got quieter.

But not normal. Nothing felt normal anymore.

Every March 5th, people give speeches about the Massacre. They call it martyrdom. They say British tyranny killed innocent Americans. The truth is more complicated — I know, I was there — but complicated truths don't make good speeches.

What I notice most is how people talk about Britain now. Before, even the angriest ones still said they were loyal subjects fighting for their rights as Englishmen. Now I hear different words. Separation. Independence. Still whispered, but I hear them more and more.

I keep thinking about those soldiers' faces. They were young. Scared. Far from home. And the crowd that night was looking for a fight — not all of them, but enough.

Everyone has reasons for what they do. That's what makes this so hard. The soldiers had reasons. The crowd had reasons. Britain has reasons for taxing us. We have reasons for resisting.

And somehow all those reasons added up to five men dead in the snow.

I'm fourteen. I should be thinking about other things. But I can't stop thinking about this: once people start dying for reasons, it's very hard to stop.

This concludes today's lesson. The Boston Massacre. Thank you for listening.
