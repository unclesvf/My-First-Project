Welcome to today's history lesson. Common Sense and Independence. The Declaration of Independence (1776).

You will hear this story from Hannah, age sixteen, daughter of a Philadelphia delegate, seventeen seventy-six.

Chapter One. Common Sense.

My name is Hannah, and I am sixteen years old. My father is a delegate to the Continental Congress, which means he spends most of his time in closed-door meetings while I wait at home, trying to piece together what's happening from his exhausted silences.

But in January, he brought home a pamphlet that changed everything.

"Common Sense," it was called. Written by a man named Thomas Paine. Father handed it to me without a word.

I read it in one sitting. Paine writes like he's talking to you directly — no Latin, no fancy philosophy, just plain English that anyone can understand. He says it's absurd for a tiny island to rule a whole continent. He says kings are just men, and there's nothing divine about passing a crown from father to son. He says America should be free.

"The birthday of a new world is at hand."

Before that pamphlet, most people — even the ones angry at Britain — wanted to work things out. Stay in the empire, but get our rights respected. But Paine says there's no working it out. We have to break away completely.

Father says 120,000 copies have sold. In a country of two and a half million people, that's... everyone. Everyone is reading it, talking about it. The word "independence" used to be radical. Now it's everywhere.

Chapter Two. Writing It Down.

In June, a delegate named Richard Henry Lee stood up in Congress and proposed that the colonies "are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States."

Free and independent. Just like that. Said out loud, in a room full of men who could hang for treason.

They appointed a committee to write a declaration: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and two others. I've seen Jefferson walking around Philadelphia, looking like he hasn't slept in weeks. Father says he's doing most of the writing.

I imagine him at his desk, choosing words that millions of people will read. No pressure.

Father came home one evening and read me a draft of the opening. He had tears in his eyes:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

I made him read it again. And again.

All men are created equal. I thought about my friend Sarah's family, who owns people. I thought about me, who can't vote or own property because I'm a girl. All men. Does Jefferson believe that? Does he know what he's promising?

"Father," I said, "if all men are created equal, then—"

"I know," he said. "I know."

Chapter Three. The Vote.

July 2nd, 1776. The day the Congress voted.

I wasn't there, obviously. Women don't belong in Congress. But Father told me everything that night, pacing back and forth, too keyed up to sit.

The debates had been brutal. Some delegates were terrified — Britain has the most powerful navy in the world, a professional army, unlimited resources. We have farmers with muskets. If we lose, everyone who signed that document will be executed.

Others said we'd already passed the point of no return. We'd been fighting for over a year. After Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill, was Britain really going to forgive us and pretend nothing happened?

Twelve colonies voted yes. New York abstained — their delegates didn't have permission yet — but they came around later.

July 4th was when they formally adopted the Declaration, with the final language approved. Church bells rang all afternoon. People gathered in the streets to hear it read aloud.

In New York, soldiers pulled down a statue of King George and melted it into bullets.

We're not British subjects anymore. We're Americans. Citizens of a country that didn't exist a week ago.

Chapter Four. What It Means.

Father explained the philosophy to me one night. Jefferson was drawing on ideas from John Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers.

The old idea was that kings ruled by divine right. God chose them, and everyone else had to obey. But Locke said governments get their power from the people. We consent to be governed because it protects our rights. If a government stops protecting us — if it becomes tyrannical — we can throw it off and start over.

That's what we're doing. Starting over.

But here's what stays with me: Jefferson wrote that all men are created equal. Not "all Englishmen" or "all property owners" or "all white people." All men.

I know he didn't mean it that way. I know he owns slaves. I know women are property in the eyes of the law. But he wrote it down, and now it's there, on paper, signed by fifty-six men.

Words are strange things. Sometimes they say more than the writer intended. Sometimes they make promises the writer can't keep.

"All men are created equal." Someday, someone is going to point at those words and demand to know why they don't apply to her. To him. To everyone.

I might live to see that. I hope I do.

Chapter Five. The Price.

After the signing, Benjamin Franklin said something I can't forget: "We must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."

He wasn't joking. Every man who signed that Declaration committed treason. If we lose this war, they die. Their families lose everything.

Father has aged ten years in the past ten months. Some nights he just sits and stares at the wall. I bring him tea and don't say anything.

British troops have already burned the homes of some signers. Families have been arrested, property confiscated. These men bet everything — their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor — on an idea.

We're fighting the most powerful empire on earth with an army of farmers and shopkeepers. We have no navy. We barely have a government. Our chances are terrible.

But Father says some things are worth any odds.

"We're not just fighting for ourselves," he told me. "We're fighting to prove that people can govern themselves. That ordinary human beings can create a country based on rights and reason, not bloodlines and bayonets. If we win, that idea will spread. Everywhere."

Standing in the State House yard when they read the Declaration aloud, I felt something I'd never felt before. Pride, but also terror. Hope, but also grief for what's coming.

We've made a promise to the world. All men created equal. Unalienable rights. Government by consent.

Now we have to keep it. Or die trying.

This concludes today's lesson. Common Sense and Independence. Thank you for listening.
