Welcome to today's history lesson. No Taxation Without Representation. The Stamp Act Crisis (1765).

You will hear this story from William, age sixteen, apprentice to a Boston printer, seventeen sixty-five.

Chapter One. The Stamp Act.

My name is William, and I am sixteen years old. I work at Master Green's printing shop on King Street in Boston. Today is March 22nd, 1765, and the news that just arrived has Master Green throwing things.

Parliament passed something called the Stamp Act. It means we have to buy special stamped paper for everything we print — newspapers, pamphlets, legal documents, even playing cards. Every page needs a tax stamp from British officials. The money goes to pay for soldiers stationed here.

Master Green hasn't stopped cursing for an hour. "This will ruin us!" His face is red and his hands shake when he holds the letter. The stamped paper costs money we don't have. Our customers can't afford higher prices. But that's not even the worst part.

"We're British subjects," he tells me, setting type with angry, precise movements. "We have the right to be taxed only by our own representatives. We don't have anyone in Parliament. Nobody speaks for us there. So how can they tax us?"

I'd never thought about it before. But once he says it, it seems obvious. If they can tax us without asking, what else can they do without asking?

"No taxation without representation," Master Green says, slamming a drawer. "Remember that phrase, William. You'll be hearing it a lot."

Chapter Two. Sons of Liberty.

I saw something last night that I'm not sure I should have seen.

A group of men gathered after dark near the Liberty Tree — that's what we call the big elm on the south end of town. They call themselves the Sons of Liberty. Samuel Adams was there, the one who writes all those angry articles about British tyranny.

They were planning something. I couldn't hear all of it, but I heard enough.

The next day, a mob surrounded the house of Andrew Oliver — he's the man the Crown appointed to distribute stamps in Massachusetts. They hung a dummy of him from the Liberty Tree. At nightfall they cut it down, paraded it through the streets, and burned it. Then they smashed up a building he owned and threw rocks through his windows while his family cowered inside.

Oliver resigned the next morning. Said he wanted nothing to do with stamps.

I stood in the crowd and cheered with everyone else. But part of me felt sick. That was a man's house. He has children. What if the mob had gone further?

But then I think about Master Green, and all the other printers and merchants and lawyers who'll be ruined by this tax. And I think maybe you can't fight tyranny politely.

I don't know. I'm sixteen. I don't know anything.

Chapter Three. Something Larger.

The strangest thing is happening: the colonies are actually working together.

We never do that. Virginia hates Massachusetts. New York hates everyone. We're thirteen separate colonies with thirteen separate problems. But this Stamp Act made everyone angry at the same time.

In October, representatives from nine colonies met in New York for something called the Stamp Act Congress. Master Green printed their declaration — I set the type myself. They said only colonial assemblies can tax colonists. Parliament can regulate trade, fine. But direct taxes? No. Not without our consent.

Meanwhile, the merchants started refusing to buy British goods. "Non-importation agreements," they call it. If Britain won't respect our rights, we won't buy their products. Hit them in the purse — that's what Samuel Adams says.

Even the women are part of it. They're forming spinning groups to make homemade cloth instead of buying British fabric. My mother joined one. She says it's the first time she's felt like she mattered to something bigger than our house.

And it worked.

March 1766 — Parliament repealed the Stamp Act. Repealed it! We won! Church bells rang all day. People danced in the streets. Master Green printed a special edition and we couldn't make copies fast enough.

But here's the thing nobody wants to talk about: Parliament also passed something called the Declaratory Act. It says they have the right to make laws for us "in all cases whatsoever." So they backed down on this tax, but they're saying they can do whatever they want.

We celebrated anyway. Maybe we shouldn't have.

Chapter Four. Here We Go Again.

1767. New taxes. They never learn.

The Townshend Acts, they're called — named after Charles Townshend, some minister in London who thought he was clever. These aren't stamps, they're duties on imported goods. Tea. Glass. Lead. Paint. Paper.

Parliament claims these are different because they're "external" taxes on trade, not "internal" taxes like the stamps. Master Green says that's nonsense. "A tax is a tax. Your pocket's lighter either way."

But the really dangerous part is what the money's for. It'll pay the salaries of royal governors and judges here in America. Right now, they depend on our colonial assemblies for their pay. That gives us some power over them. But if Britain pays them directly...

"Then they'll serve the King, not us," Master Green explains. "They won't care what we think. We'll have no leverage at all."

They're also using something called writs of assistance — search warrants that let customs officials break into any building looking for smuggled goods. No specific cause needed. Just suspicion.

The boycotts started again. More spinning bees. More angry pamphlets. More crowds in the streets.

It's like we're caught in a wheel that keeps turning, and every time it comes around, it turns a little faster.

Chapter Five. What I've Learned.

I'm not a child anymore. I used to think politics was for important men in wigs. Now I know it's for everyone.

I'm just a printer's apprentice. But when I set type for a pamphlet about natural rights, those words go out into the world. When I refuse to buy British tea, that's one less sale for a London merchant. When Master Green prints the names of importers who break the boycott, those men face their neighbors' scorn.

It adds up. All of us, making small choices, becoming something larger.

My mother says she's never felt so alive. She hosts a spinning bee every Thursday — a dozen women making cloth and talking about liberty. She tells me women have always been told to be quiet and do as they're told. "This is the first time anyone asked us to be part of something," she says. "The first time our choices mattered."

I still don't know where this ends. Maybe we'll force Britain to back down again. Maybe they'll push harder and we'll push back. Maybe it'll come to something worse.

But I know what I believe now. We have rights. Real rights that don't depend on some Parliament three thousand miles away deciding to be generous. We're subjects of the King, yes. But that's supposed to mean something. We're not supposed to be squeezed for money we didn't agree to pay, searched without cause, governed by men who answer to London instead of us.

No taxation without representation. It's not just a slogan. It's what I believe.

And I think, whatever comes, I'll stand by it.

This concludes today's lesson. No Taxation Without Representation. Thank you for listening.
