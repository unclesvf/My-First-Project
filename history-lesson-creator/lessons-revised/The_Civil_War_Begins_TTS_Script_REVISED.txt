Welcome to today's history lesson. The Civil War Begins. Bull Run to Antietam (1861-1862).

You will hear this story from Thomas, age seventeen, Union soldier, eighteen sixty-two.

Chapter One. First Bull Run.

I'm Thomas, seventeen years old, and I enlisted in May 1861 because I was certain the war would be over before I had a chance to fight.

Everyone thought that. "Ninety days," the recruiters said. "One good battle and they'll quit." We'd march to Richmond, capture Jeff Davis, and be home by harvest.

July 21, 1861. The Battle of Bull Run.

Civilians came from Washington to watch. They brought picnic baskets and opera glasses, like it was a show. Congressmen. Society ladies. They set up on hillsides to see the entertainment.

At first, it went our way. We pushed the Confederates back. By afternoon, I thought we were winning.

Then Confederate reinforcements arrived. There was a general named Thomas Jackson who wouldn't retreat no matter how hard we hit him. "There stands Jackson like a stone wall!" someone shouted. The name stuck.

More Rebels came. They counterattacked. Our line broke.

Someone yelled "Retreat!" and suddenly we were running. All of us. Thousands of men dropping weapons and running. The civilians who'd come to watch got caught in the chaos, their carriages overturned.

I ran too. I'm not proud of it. But when that many men run, you run.

We didn't stop until we reached Washington, exhausted and humiliated.

The war wouldn't be quick. It wouldn't be easy. The Rebels could fight.

Chapter Two. Learning to Be Soldiers.

After Bull Run, General McClellan took over. He was young, confident, organized. He drilled us constantly — marching, loading, firing, digging. Raw recruits became actual soldiers.

But McClellan was cautious. Too cautious. He always thought the enemy had more men than they did. He trained us for months while Lincoln grew impatient. "If McClellan isn't going to use his army," Lincoln said, "I'd like to borrow it."

I learned what war really meant — not from battles, but from camp. The camps were filthy, crowded, breeding grounds for disease. For every man killed in combat, two died of typhoid or dysentery.

My friend William died of typhoid fever. Never fired a shot at the enemy. Just got sick and died, far from home, in a dirty camp hospital.

Letters from home said people were shocked by the casualty lists. The romance of war faded fast. But Lincoln insisted: we had to preserve the Union. If states could leave whenever they lost an election, the whole experiment in democracy was finished.

The war's purpose was evolving too. At first, we fought to save the Union, not to free slaves. But as enslaved people fled to Union lines, seeking protection, we couldn't ignore slavery anymore.

We called them "contraband" — Confederate property now in our hands. A legal fiction. But they helped us, giving information about Rebel positions, working as laborers. How could we send them back to slavery while fighting their masters?

Chapter Three. The Peninsula Campaign.

Spring 1862. McClellan finally moved. He landed over a hundred thousand men on the Virginia peninsula, planning to march up to Richmond.

We got within sight of the city. We could see the church spires. So close.

Then General Joseph Johnston was wounded, and Robert E. Lee took command of the Confederate army.

Everything changed.

Lee attacked us for seven straight days. The Seven Days Battles, they called them. McClellan panicked and retreated. We lost more men than Lee did, but McClellan was so scared he pulled us back to the James River.

At Gaines' Mill, Confederates attacked our position over and over. The noise was incredible — thousands of rifles, artillery booming, men screaming. We held for hours before being ordered to retreat.

At Malvern Hill, we slaughtered them. They charged across open ground into our artillery fire. Bodies everywhere. We won that battle. And McClellan retreated anyway.

The Peninsula Campaign failed. We'd gotten within sight of Richmond and accomplished nothing except killing thousands of men.

I learned that generals matter. McClellan was brilliant at organizing but terrible at fighting. Lee was the opposite — aggressive, willing to take risks. Unless we found better generals, this war would last years.

Chapter Four. Second Bull Run.

August 1862. Same battlefield where we'd been humiliated a year earlier. Same result.

General Pope replaced McClellan. Pope was arrogant. "I have come from the West, where we always see the backs of our enemies," he boasted.

Lee and Jackson outmaneuvered him. Jackson marched around our flank and attacked our supply depot. Pope tried to trap Jackson, but Lee arrived with reinforcements.

Longstreet's corps — twenty-eight thousand men — hit our flank while we were focused on Jackson. Our line collapsed. We ran back to Washington again.

Two defeats at the same place.

But then Lee made a mistake. Instead of waiting for us to attack, he invaded Maryland.

McClellan, restored to command, marched out to meet him. We were tired and beaten down by defeats. But we were also angry. The Rebels were invading our territory now. This was different.

The armies converged on a little Maryland town called Sharpsburg, along a creek called Antietam.

Chapter Five. The Bloodiest Day.

September 17, 1862. Twenty-three thousand men killed, wounded, or missing in twelve hours. The bloodiest single day in American history.

I was in the assault on the Sunken Road. Later they called it Bloody Lane.

Confederate infantry dug into a road worn below the level of the surrounding fields. They fired volley after volley as we advanced across open ground. Men fell in waves. We'd get close, fire, retreat, attack again.

Bodies piled up. The smell of blood and gunpowder was thick enough to choke on. For three hours we fought for that road.

Finally we flanked them. When we got into the road itself, it was filled with Confederate dead and wounded. Thick enough to walk on without touching the ground.

Meanwhile, other battles raged. At the Cornfield, men fought back and forth through tall corn until every stalk was cut down by bullets. At Burnside's Bridge, we spent hours trying to cross a narrow stone bridge under Confederate fire.

By evening, both armies were exhausted. Neither had won. But Lee retreated back to Virginia. His invasion failed.

Five days later, Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation. On January 1, 1863, all slaves in the rebellious states would be free.

The war changed. We weren't just fighting to save the Union anymore. We were fighting to end slavery.

I thought about the Sunken Road, the bodies, the smell. I thought about William dying of typhoid. I thought about what the war had cost us.

And I thought: maybe it's worth it. Maybe this is what we're really fighting for. Not just keeping the country together, but making it better. Making it mean what it always said it meant.

All men created equal. Maybe now we'd actually have to mean it.

This concludes today's lesson. The Civil War Begins. Thank you for listening.
