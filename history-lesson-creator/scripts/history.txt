### CHAPTER 1: The Journey Begins

My name is Mateo, and I am thirteen years old. Today marks my first full year in this strange new land called La Florida. I still remember the smell of the salt air as our ship approached the coast, the way my stomach churned—not from seasickness, but from fear and excitement twisted together like rope.

Father told me we were coming to build a new life, to claim land for Spain and spread our faith. The King himself had sent us, led by Don Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, to establish a settlement and drive out the French who dared to settle in Spanish territory.

When we first landed, the heat was unlike anything I'd known in Seville. The air was thick and heavy, and strange birds called from trees I'd never seen before. The indigenous Timucua people watched us from the forest edge—curious, cautious, but not yet hostile.

We called our settlement St. Augustine, and immediately set to work building wooden fortifications. Every day, I helped carry timber and dig trenches. My hands, once soft from my mother's gentle care, grew calloused and strong.

### CHAPTER 2: Survival and Struggle

The first months were the hardest. We planted crops, but the soil was different here, and many plants withered in the unforgiving sun. Fish from the nearby waters kept us alive when our Spanish provisions ran low.

I learned to respect the Timucua. They showed us which plants were safe to eat, how to track animals through the palmetto scrub, and where to find fresh water. Without them, I don't think we would have survived.

But tension simmered beneath our fragile peace. Some Spanish soldiers treated the Timucua poorly, demanding food and labor. Father argued with the garrison commander about this, saying we would never truly settle here if we made enemies of those who knew the land.

I befriended a Timucua boy named Ahone, who was about my age. He taught me words in his language, and I taught him Spanish. We would meet by the river when we could, away from the suspicious eyes of both our peoples.

### CHAPTER 3: Building a New World

As seasons passed, St. Augustine grew from a desperate outpost into something resembling a town. We built a wooden chapel where Father Alonso held mass each Sunday. Stone replaced wood in our most important buildings, making them strong against both storms and attack.

Supplies arrived from Havana every few months—tools, seeds, fabric, and news from Spain. Each ship brought new settlers: farmers, craftsmen, soldiers, and priests. The settlement expanded, pushing deeper into the wilderness.

The Spanish Crown wanted us to convert the indigenous people to Christianity and make them subjects of King Philip II. Some missionaries succeeded in baptizing Timucua families, but others resisted, clinging to their old ways and gods.

I often wondered what Ahone thought about all this—his world changing so rapidly, his people's land filling with strangers who spoke of a distant king and demanded obedience. When I asked him once, he simply said, "The world has always been changing, Mateo. The question is whether we change with it or are swept away."

### CHAPTER 4: Two Worlds Collide

By my second year in St. Augustine, I understood that we were not just building a settlement—we were building an empire. Spain claimed this land, and settlements like ours were the foundation of that claim.

Father explained that England had established Jamestown to the north, just a few years ago. Like us, they struggled to survive, depending on the indigenous Powhatan people for food and knowledge. Like us, they came seeking riches, land, and glory for their kingdom.

I realized then that this "New World" was not new at all—it was ancient, with people who had lived here for generations beyond counting. What was new was us: the Spanish, the English, the French, all scrambling to plant our flags and claim what was never ours to claim.

Yet here I am, part of this great collision of worlds. My children will be born in this land, speaking Spanish but living lives my grandparents in Seville could never imagine. We are creating something new from the meeting of old worlds—though at what cost, I'm still not sure.

### CHAPTER 5: Reflections on Settlement

Looking back now, I see the pattern clearly. Both Spanish St. Augustine and English Jamestown were established for similar reasons: to claim territory, find wealth, spread religion, and expand empires. We both struggled through harsh conditions, disease, and starvation.

We both depended on indigenous peoples for survival, yet both of our nations sought to dominate them. The Spanish used the *encomienda* system, forcing indigenous people to labor in exchange for supposed "protection" and religious instruction. The English in Jamestown would soon develop similar exploitative relationships with the Powhatan.

What makes me sad is how little we learn from each other's humanity. The Timucua, the Powhatan—they are not obstacles to overcome or resources to exploit. They are people with their own rich cultures, histories, and rights to this land.

Father once told me that history is written by those who build the strongest settlements and win the most battles. But I wonder: what will history say about us? Will it remember the bravery of exploration, or the tragedy of conquest? Will it honor the Timucua and Powhatan voices, or silence them beneath the weight of European ambition?

These are the questions I carry with me as I grow into manhood in this New World—questions that have no easy answers, but must be asked nonetheless.
