          title: "A New Kind of President",
          content: `I'm Thomas, fifteen, from Tennessee. Today Andrew Jackson was inaugurated as President, and everything feels different. Jackson isn't from a wealthy Eastern family like previous presidents—he's from the frontier, like us. He's a war hero, a self-made man, someone who speaks for common people, not just the elite.

At his inauguration, thousands of ordinary people flooded Washington. They crowded into the White House, tracking mud on carpets, breaking china, standing on furniture to see "Old Hickory." The previous administration was horrified. But to us, it showed democracy in action—the people's President welcoming the people into the people's house.

Jackson believes in the "common man." He expanded voting rights—most states have dropped property requirements, so now most white men can vote regardless of wealth. Political power is spreading beyond the elite. This is "Jacksonian Democracy"—the idea that ordinary citizens should participate actively in government.`

          title: "The Spoils System",
          content: `Jackson introduced the "spoils system"—rewarding political supporters with government jobs. "To the victor belong the spoils," his supporters said. He fired many federal employees and replaced them with his own people.

Critics called this corruption—giving jobs based on loyalty rather than merit. But Jackson argued that government jobs aren't so complicated that ordinary men can't do them. Why should positions be reserved for an educated elite? Rotation in office prevents bureaucrats from becoming too powerful.

I see both sides. Father got a postmaster job because he supported Jackson—he's proud to serve. But the previous postmaster, who was competent, lost his job for political reasons. Democracy is messy. Expanding participation means empowering people who might not always make wise choices. But isn't that better than rule by an elite few?`

          title: "The Bank War",
          content: `Jackson's biggest battle was against the Second Bank of the United States. This national bank, chartered by Congress, controlled much of the nation's money and credit. Jackson saw it as a corrupt monopoly that favored wealthy Eastern elites over common farmers and workers.

The Bank's president, Nicholas Biddle, was everything Jackson hated—educated, aristocratic, powerful. Biddle used the Bank's financial power to influence politics, extending credit to supportive newspapers and politicians while denying it to opponents. Jackson called the Bank "a hydra of corruption" and vowed to destroy it.

When Congress re-chartered the Bank in 1832, Jackson vetoed it. His veto message was powerful: the Bank gave special privileges to the wealthy, foreign investors, and Eastern elites. It concentrated dangerous economic power in private hands. Jackson painted it as democracy versus aristocracy, the people versus privilege.

The Bank War became the central issue of the 1832 election. Jackson won overwhelmingly, taking it as a mandate to destroy the Bank. He withdrew federal deposits and placed them in state banks—his opponents called them "pet banks." By 1836, the Second Bank's charter expired. Jackson had killed it.

Father celebrated—we hated the Bank's power over western farmers like us. But some warned that destroying the Bank removed restraints on reckless state banks, leading to inflation and economic chaos. They were right—the Panic of 1837 devastated the economy. Jackson's democratic impulses had unintended consequences.`

          title: "The Rise of the Common Man",
          content: `Jackson's presidency transformed American democracy. Before him, politics was dominated by wealthy, educated elites from established families. Jackson proved that a frontier-born, self-made man could become president. He spoke for farmers, workers, and western settlers—"the common man."

Voter participation exploded. In 1824, only about 27% of eligible voters participated in the presidential election. By 1840, it was over 80%. States eliminated property requirements for voting. Political parties held conventions where delegates nominated candidates, replacing the old system where party elites chose in secret caucuses.

Political campaigns became spectacles. There were parades, rallies, barbecues, and mass meetings. Politicians had to appeal directly to voters, not just to elite kingmakers. This made politics more democratic but also more populist—politicians told people what they wanted to hear, not always what they needed to hear.

I watched my father and his friends become politically engaged in ways their fathers never were. They attended rallies, debated policies, voted with pride. They felt that government finally represented them, not just the wealthy. This was Jacksonian Democracy in action—the political empowerment of ordinary white men.

But "common man" had limits. Women couldn't vote. Free Black men lost voting rights in many states. Enslaved people had no rights at all. Native Americans were being pushed westward. Jacksonian Democracy expanded political participation for white men while contracting it for others. The age of the common (white) man was built on exclusion as much as inclusion.`

          title: "The Democratic Revolution",
          content: `Jackson's legacy is contradictory. He democratized American politics, making government more responsive to ordinary citizens. He fought economic elites and broke their monopoly on power. He proved that anyone—even a orphaned frontier boy—could rise to the presidency. He made Americans believe in themselves and their democratic system.

But he also concentrated power in the presidency, using vetoes and executive authority in unprecedented ways. He ignored Supreme Court decisions he disliked. He rewarded political loyalty over competence. His economic policies, while democratically popular, led to financial disaster. His Indian removal policy was genocidal.

Most troubling was what Jacksonian Democracy revealed about democracy itself. When "the people" rule, which people? The majority can oppress minorities. Popular policy isn't always wise policy. Charismatic leaders can manipulate democratic systems. Democracy requires more than majority rule—it needs protection for minority rights, limits on government power, and educated, engaged citizens.

Walking through Washington at Jackson's second inauguration, I saw America's democratic spirit unleashed. Thousands of ordinary people, dressed in their Sunday best, celebrated their president and their power. It was inspiring and a bit frightening. Democracy was no longer theoretical—it was real, messy, powerful, and unpredictable.

Father said it best: "Jackson proved government can serve common people, not just elites. But he also showed democracy's dangers—mob rule, demagoguery, majority tyranny. Future generations must take the good—political participation, opportunity, faith in common people—while avoiding the bad. That's the challenge of Jacksonian Democracy: harnessing the people's power without unleashing the people's worst impulses."

The age of the common man had arrived. America would never be the same. For better and worse, we'd proven that democracy could work on a large scale, that ordinary people could govern themselves. The world was watching, and we were showing them something new—government by the people, truly and messily.`
