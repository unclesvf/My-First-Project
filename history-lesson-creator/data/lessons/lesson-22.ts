          title: "A Territory Changes Hands",
          content: `I'm Marie, fourteen, living in New Orleans. My city has been French, then Spanish, now French again, and today I learned we're about to become American! The news arrived: President Jefferson has purchased all of Louisiana from Napoleon for $15 million.

The Louisiana Territory is enormous—over 800,000 square miles stretching from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains. It doubles the size of the United States! Napoleon needed money for his wars in Europe and feared losing Louisiana to Britain, so he sold it to America.

President Jefferson faced a dilemma. The Constitution doesn't explicitly say the president can buy territory. Jefferson believes in strict interpretation—the federal government should only have powers specifically listed in the Constitution. But this deal is too good to pass up. He approved it anyway, setting aside his principles for practical benefit.`
        },
        {
          title: "New Opportunities",
          content: `The Purchase solves major problems for America. We needed access to New Orleans—the mouth of the Mississippi River where western farmers ship their goods. France controlling it was dangerous. Now America controls the entire Mississippi River system.

The territory offers endless land for settlement. Thomas Jefferson imagines an "empire of liberty"—a vast nation of independent farmers spreading across the continent. This land makes that vision possible.

But questions loom. What about the Native peoples living there? What about slavery—will it spread into these new territories? How do you govern such a vast area? These questions will haunt America for decades, eventually leading to civil war. For now, though, Americans celebrate. We've doubled our nation's size for just three cents an acre.`
        },
        {
          title: "Jefferson's Dilemma",
          content: `My father explains President Jefferson's predicament. Jefferson has always preached strict construction—the federal government should only exercise powers explicitly granted in the Constitution. He's criticized Hamilton and the Federalists for loose interpretation, claiming they stretch the Constitution to justify whatever they want.

But the Constitution says nothing about purchasing foreign territory. Nowhere does it grant the president or Congress the power to buy land from other nations. By Jefferson's own principles, the Louisiana Purchase might be unconstitutional.

Jefferson agonized over this. He drafted a constitutional amendment to explicitly allow the purchase. But his advisors warned that seeking an amendment would take time, and Napoleon might change his mind or demand a higher price. The opportunity might slip away.

In the end, Jefferson swallowed his principles and authorized the purchase. He argued weakly that the treaty-making power implied the right to acquire territory. Federalists laughed at his hypocrisy—Jefferson was doing exactly what he'd accused them of doing, stretching the Constitution to justify what he wanted.

"Sometimes principles must bend to reality," Father says, though he's a Jefferson supporter. "Would it have been better to follow strict construction and lose half a continent? Jefferson made the right choice, even if it contradicted his philosophy." I wonder if Father is right, or if Jefferson proved that principles matter less than power.`

          title: "Life in New Orleans",
          content: `My city, New Orleans, is unlike anywhere else in America. We're French and Spanish, Catholic and Creole. We speak French more than English. We have free people of color who own businesses and property—something unheard of in most of America. Our food, music, and culture come from a blend of French, Spanish, African, and Caribbean influences.

Now we're becoming American, and no one knows what that means for us. Will they respect our language and religion? Will they honor our land grants and legal traditions? Will they accept our free Black population, or try to force everyone into their rigid system of slavery versus freedom?

American officials arrive talking about "civilizing" us, teaching us "American ways." They look down on our culture as backward and foreign. They're shocked by our festivals, our mixed-race communities, our Catholic schools. Some Americans talk about New Orleans like we're exotic territory to be conquered, not fellow citizens to be respected.

But Father is hopeful. "America is an idea, not an ethnicity," he says. "They'll have to learn that America can include French-speaking Catholics from New Orleans. We'll make them expand their understanding of what American means." I hope he's right. The Louisiana Purchase didn't just add land to America—it added us, people whose culture and traditions challenge America's assumptions about itself.`
        },
        {
          title: "The Price of Expansion",
          content: `While Americans celebrate acquiring vast new territory, few ask about the people already living there. Tens of thousands of Native peoples call Louisiana home: Osage, Caddo, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and dozens of other nations. France just sold their land without their consent. America just bought it without acknowledging Native ownership.

My father trades with Native peoples along the Mississippi. "They're furious," he tells me. "France had no right to sell their land. America has no right to claim it. They've been here for thousands of years—how can someone sell what they don't own?"

But Americans see it differently. They believe European nations have sovereignty over North America through "discovery" and conquest. Native peoples might live on the land, but they don't "own" it in the legal sense European powers recognize. It's a convenient fiction that allows Americans to claim an enormous territory as vacant land ready for settlement.

Jefferson talks about his "empire of liberty," but whose liberty? Not the Native nations whose lands we've purchased. Not the enslaved people who'll be brought into these territories as slavery expands westward. The Louisiana Purchase doubles America's size, but it also doubles our fundamental contradictions.

Standing in New Orleans as the American flag replaces the French tricolor, I wonder what we've really bought. Land, yes—800,000 square miles of it. But we've also bought new questions that will tear at the nation's soul: How far west will slavery spread? What happens to Native peoples in the path of American expansion? Can a nation founded on liberty spread by taking land from its original inhabitants?

For now, Americans celebrate. The Louisiana Purchase seems like pure triumph—doubled land, access to the Mississippi, room for generations to grow. But I sense the questions we're avoiding will someday demand answers. You can purchase land, but you can't purchase the solution to moral dilemmas.`
