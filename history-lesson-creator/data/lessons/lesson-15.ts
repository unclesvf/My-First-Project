          title: "Common Sense",
          content: `My name is Hannah, and I am sixteen years old. My father is a delegate to the Continental Congress meeting here in Philadelphia. In January, a pamphlet called "Common Sense" by Thomas Paine swept through the colonies like wildfire. Father brought a copy home, and I read it with amazement.

Paine writes in plain language anyone can understand. He argues that it's absurd for a continent to be governed by an island, that hereditary monarchy is unjust, that America should be independent. His words are revolutionary: "The birthday of a new world is at hand."

Before "Common Sense," many colonists hoped to reconcile with Britain. We wanted our rights as British subjects restored. But Paine argues we should be our own nation. Within months, 120,000 copies sold in a population of 2.5 million. Everyone is talking about independence now.`

          title: "Writing the Declaration",
          content: `On June 7, Richard Henry Lee proposed that "these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States." The Congress appointed a committee to draft a declaration: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and two others.

Jefferson did most of the writing. I saw him around Philadelphia, looking tired and worried. He wrote at a portable desk in his rented room, choosing each word carefully. He based it on Enlightenment ideas—natural rights, consent of the governed, the right to alter or abolish government.

The Declaration lists grievances against King George III, but the most powerful part is the beginning: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

These words will change the world. They don't just justify our rebellion—they express universal principles about human rights and government. Though I notice the irony: we say all men are created equal while many colonists own slaves. This contradiction will haunt our new nation.`

        {
          title: "The Vote for Independence",
          content: `On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence. Twelve colonies voted yes; New York abstained but later agreed. July 2 is actually Independence Day, though we'll celebrate July 4, when the Declaration was formally adopted.

The debates were intense. Some delegates feared we couldn't win against Britain. Others worried about what came next—how do you build a nation from scratch? But the momentum was unstoppable. After Lexington, Bunker Hill, and a year of war, there was no turning back.

On July 4, the Congress adopted the Declaration. Church bells rang. Crowds gathered. The document was read aloud to cheering citizens. In New York, soldiers toppled a statue of King George III. We've burned our bridges. We're no longer fighting for our rights as British subjects—we're fighting for independence as a new nation: the United States of America.`
        },
        {
          title: "Revolutionary Ideas",
          content: `The Declaration is more than a list of complaints against King George. It's a statement of revolutionary political philosophy drawn from Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke. The ideas it expresses will echo through history.

First, it asserts that all people have natural rights that governments cannot legitimately take away. This contradicts the old idea that monarchs rule by divine right. Instead, governments exist to protect people's rights, and their power comes from the consent of the governed.

Second, it declares that when government becomes tyrannical, the people have the right—even the duty—to alter or abolish it and create new government. This justifies revolution as a legitimate political act when circumstances warrant it.

Third, though it says "all men are created equal," the Declaration plants seeds of universal human equality. Over time, groups denied these rights—women, enslaved people, indigenous peoples, workers—will point to these words and demand their own freedom and equality.

Father says the Declaration creates a promise America must strive to fulfill. We've declared these principles, but we don't yet live up to them. The real revolution won't be won just on battlefields—it will be the long struggle to make our practices match our principles.`
        },
        {
          title: "The Price of Freedom",
          content: `After the signing, Benjamin Franklin reportedly said, "We must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately." He meant it literally. By signing the Declaration, fifty-six men committed treason against Britain. If we lose this war, they'll be executed.

I've watched the strain on Father's face. Some signers have already paid dearly. British troops have burned homes, confiscated property, and imprisoned family members. These men have pledged "our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor" to this cause. They're risking everything for an uncertain future.

And it's not just the signers. Every soldier in the Continental Army is now a traitor to Britain. Every citizen supporting independence risks punishment. We've chosen a dangerous path. We're fighting the most powerful empire on Earth, with the world's strongest navy and a professional army. Our chances seem slim.

But Father says some things are worth any price. "We're not just fighting for ourselves," he told me. "We're fighting for the principle that people have the right to govern themselves. If we succeed, we'll prove that ordinary people can create their own government based on reason and rights, not tradition and force. That idea will change the world."

Standing in Independence Hall as the Declaration was read, I felt the weight of history. We've started something that won't end with this war. We've proclaimed ideals that will challenge tyranny everywhere. We've declared not just our independence, but humanity's right to freedom. Whatever happens next, there's no going back. We're Americans now, and we're free—or we'll die trying.`
