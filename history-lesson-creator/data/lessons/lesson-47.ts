          title: "Drowning in Debt",
          content: `I'm Emma, sixteen years old, and I live on a wheat farm in Kansas. My family works from sunrise to sunset planting, tending, and harvesting wheat. We work harder every year. Yet every year we sink deeper into debt.

The problem isn't laziness. We produce more wheat than ever. But the more we produce, the lower prices fall. In 1870, wheat sold for $1.50 per bushel. Now in 1896, it's 50 cents. We produce three times as much wheat but earn less money.

Meanwhile, our costs keep rising. The railroad monopolies charge whatever they want to ship our crops to market. We have no choice—there's only one railroad through Kansas. They charge us high rates while giving rebates to big corporations.

Banks charge crushing interest rates on loans. We borrowed money to buy equipment and seed. Now we owe more than our farm is worth. If we can't pay, the bank will foreclose—take our land and auction it.

Farm equipment manufacturers, seed companies, grain elevator operators—they all charge high prices because they control the market. We're price-takers, not price-makers. We sell our wheat at whatever price buyers offer and buy supplies at whatever price sellers demand.

Father sits at the kitchen table calculating debts. "We worked all year," he says, "and we're $200 deeper in debt." Mother cries quietly. My younger siblings don't understand why we work so hard yet have so little.

This is the farmers' crisis of the 1890s. We're the backbone of America—we feed the nation—yet we're being crushed by railroads, banks, and corporations. Something has to change.`

          title: "The Farmers' Alliance",
          content: `Farmers across the country are organizing. The Farmers' Alliance starts in Texas and spreads across the South and West. By 1890, it has over a million members.

The Alliance holds meetings in schoolhouses and churches. Farmers share their struggles and realize we all face the same problems: falling crop prices, railroad monopolies, high interest rates, lack of political power.

The Alliance tries cooperative solutions. We establish cooperative grain elevators to store crops and avoid middlemen. We create cooperative stores to buy supplies in bulk at lower prices. We negotiate with railroads for better shipping rates.

Some cooperatives succeed, but most fail. Railroads refuse to negotiate. Banks won't lend to cooperatives. Large corporations undercut our prices until we go bankrupt. We realize economic cooperation isn't enough—we need political power.

The Alliance becomes political. We demand reforms:

• Government regulation of railroads and grain elevators
• Graduated income tax so the wealthy pay their fair share
• Direct election of senators (currently state legislatures elect them, and corporations control legislatures)
• Government ownership of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones
• Unlimited coinage of silver to increase the money supply

This last demand—"free silver"—is crucial. The money supply is based on gold. As the economy grows, there's not enough money in circulation. This causes deflation—prices fall, making debts harder to repay. We owe debts in dollars that are worth more each year.

If the government coined unlimited silver, the money supply would increase. This would cause inflation—prices would rise, making debts easier to repay. Creditors oppose this because it reduces the real value of money owed to them. But debtors like us support it desperately.`

          title: "The People's Party",
          content: `In 1892, the Farmers' Alliance forms a political party: the People's Party, also called the Populist Party. At the founding convention in Omaha, Nebraska, we adopt a platform demanding sweeping reforms.

The preamble is radical: "We meet in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral, political, and material ruin. Corruption dominates the ballot-box, the Legislatures, the Congress... The fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few... From the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed the two great classes—tramps and millionaires."

Our platform demands:
• Free and unlimited coinage of silver
• Graduated income tax
• Government ownership of railroads
• Direct election of senators
• Eight-hour workday for industrial workers
• Immigration restriction

We're trying to unite farmers, workers, and reformers against corporate power. We see ourselves as the producing class—people who create wealth through labor—fighting against parasites who profit from our work without contributing.

In 1892, our candidate James Weaver wins over a million votes and 22 electoral votes. In Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and other western states, Populists win governorships and congressional seats. We're a serious political force.

But we face opposition from both major parties. Democrats and Republicans unite to defeat us. Newspapers call us radicals, socialists, and anarchists. Banks and railroads fund campaigns against us. Violence and fraud mar elections.

Still, we're building a movement. For the first time, farmers have a political voice. We're challenging corporate power and demanding that government serve the people, not just the wealthy.`

          title: "The Cross of Gold",
          content: `1896. The presidential election focuses on the money question: gold standard or free silver?

Republicans nominate William McKinley, who supports the gold standard. He's backed by banks, corporations, and Eastern financial interests. His campaign manager, Mark Hanna, raises millions from wealthy donors.

Democrats are divided. Then William Jennings Bryan, a 36-year-old congressman from Nebraska, gives the most electrifying speech in American political history at the Democratic National Convention.

Bryan's "Cross of Gold" speech defends free silver and attacks the gold standard:

"There are two ideas of government. There are those who believe that if you just legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, that their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it."

He attacks Eastern bankers and defends farmers and workers:

"You come to us and tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard. I tell you that the great cities rest upon these broad and fertile prairies. Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country."

Then his closing, arms outstretched as if crucified:

"You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!"

The convention erupts. Bryan wins the Democratic nomination. The Populist Party also nominates him. We finally have a candidate who speaks for us, who understands our suffering, who will fight the money power.

The campaign is intense. Bryan travels 18,000 miles, gives 600 speeches. McKinley stays home, running a "front porch campaign" funded by corporate millions. We farmers work desperately for Bryan—our last hope.`

          title: "Defeat and Legacy",
          content: `November 1896. McKinley wins. He carries the Northeast, Midwest, and urban areas. Bryan carries the South and rural West. The split is clear: cities and industry versus farms and agriculture. Corporate power versus the people.

We're devastated. Father sits silent at dinner. "They outspent us ten to one," he says. "Banks, railroads, corporations—all their money went to McKinley. How can we compete?"

The Populist Party declines after 1896. Some Populists join the Democrats. Others give up on politics. The movement fragments and fades.

But our ideas don't die. Many Populist demands will be achieved in the Progressive Era:

• The graduated income tax (Sixteenth Amendment, 1913)
• Direct election of senators (Seventeenth Amendment, 1913)
• Government regulation of railroads (Interstate Commerce Commission strengthened)
• Labor reforms including the eight-hour day
• Initiative, referendum, and recall in many states

We lost the battle but influenced the war. We showed that farmers and workers could organize politically, that corporate power could be challenged, that government could serve ordinary people rather than just the wealthy.

I'm eighteen now. Our farm survived—barely. We're still in debt, still struggling. But I learned something from the Populist movement: change is possible if people organize and fight for it.

The Populists proved that ordinary Americans could articulate a vision for a more just society and build a political movement to achieve it. We failed to win the presidency, but we changed the conversation. We pushed reforms that major parties eventually adopted. We showed that American democracy could be more than a choice between two corporate-backed parties.

The struggle between concentrated wealth and democracy continues. The Populists showed one path forward: organize the people against the plutocrats. Whether through elections, cooperatives, or direct action, ordinary Americans have power if we use it collectively.

Father says the Populist Party failed, but the Populist spirit survives. Every time farmers organize, workers strike, or citizens demand their government serve the people rather than the powerful—that's the Populist legacy. We didn't win in 1896, but we planted seeds that will keep growing.`

      {id: "q47-2", question: "What did Populists demand?", options: ["Lower farm prices", "Regulate railroads, income tax, direct senator election, free silver", "No government", "Return to monarchy"], correctOptionIndex: 1, explanation: "Populists demanded government regulation of railroads, graduated income tax, direct election of senators, and free silver coinage."},
      {id: "q47-3", question: "What was 'Cross of Gold'?", options: ["Jewelry", "Bryan's famous speech supporting free silver", "A building", "A book"], correctOptionIndex: 1, explanation: "Bryan's famous 1896 speech supporting free silver coinage to help farmers and working people."},
      {id: "q47-4", question: "Why did farmers support free silver coinage?", options: ["They collected silver", "More currency would cause inflation, raising crop prices and making debts easier to pay", "They opposed it", "It had no effect"], correctOptionIndex: 1, explanation: "Farmers were crushed by debt denominated in expensive gold-backed dollars. Free silver would increase money supply, causing inflation. Inflation would raise crop prices (helping farmers sell) and reduce real debt burden (making debts easier to pay with cheaper dollars). Creditors opposed this for the same reasons."},
      {id: "q47-5", question: "How did railroad monopolies exploit farmers?", options: ["They helped farmers", "Railroads charged high rates to ship crops, controlled grain storage, and farmers had no alternative transportation", "Farmers owned railroads", "Railroads gave free service"], correctOptionIndex: 1, explanation: "Railroads had monopolies on transportation—farmers couldn't ship crops to market any other way. Railroads charged whatever they wanted, gave discounts to big shippers but not small farmers, controlled grain elevators, and farmers were powerless. A farmer might lose money on crops just paying railroad fees."},
      {id: "q47-6", question: "What Populist reforms were eventually adopted?", options: ["None were adopted", "Direct election of senators (17th Amendment), graduated income tax (16th Amendment), railroad regulation", "All demands immediately", "Monarchy was restored"], correctOptionIndex: 1, explanation: "Though Populists lost the 1896 election, many of their 'radical' demands were later adopted: direct election of senators (17th Amendment, 1913), graduated income tax (16th Amendment, 1913), government regulation of railroads and banks, initiative and referendum in many states. The Populists lost but their ideas won."},
      {id: "q47-7", question: "Why did the Populist Party collapse after 1896?", options: ["It achieved all goals", "Fused with Democrats behind Bryan, lost identity; Bryan's defeat demoralized supporters", "It grew stronger", "Farmers became wealthy"], correctOptionIndex: 1, explanation: "The Populist Party made the strategic mistake of fusing with the Democratic Party and endorsing Bryan in 1896 rather than running their own candidate. When Bryan lost, the Populist Party had lost its independent identity and couldn't recover. Many Populists felt betrayed by the fusion strategy that subordinated their broader reform agenda to the single issue of free silver."},
      {id: "q47-8", question: "What was the Populists' broader significance beyond their specific demands?", options: ["They had no significance", "Showed ordinary Americans could organize politically to challenge corporate power and demand government serve the people", "They supported corporations", "They opposed democracy"], correctOptionIndex: 1, explanation: "The Populists demonstrated that ordinary farmers and workers could organize a political movement challenging corporate power. They articulated a vision where government serves the people, not just the wealthy. Though they failed electorally, they proved political organizing could challenge the plutocracy and inspire future reform movements. Their spirit lives on whenever citizens organize to demand economic justice."}
