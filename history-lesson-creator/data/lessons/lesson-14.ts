          title: "The Midnight Ride",
          content: `My name is Nathan, and I am seventeen years old. I'm a Minuteman—part of our militia trained to be ready at a minute's notice. Tonight, April 18, 1775, that training will be tested.

Word has reached us that British troops are marching from Boston to seize our weapons and gunpowder stored in Concord, and possibly to arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock who are hiding in Lexington. We've been preparing for this. The Sons of Liberty have a warning system—lanterns in the Old North Church steeple. "One if by land, two if by sea."

Paul Revere and William Dawes have ridden through the night warning us: "The Regulars are out!" They're coming. At dawn, British soldiers—about 700 of them—will reach Lexington, then Concord. We're outnumbered, but this is our land, our liberty. We will make a stand.

I've grabbed my musket, my powder horn, and my shot pouch. My mother holds back tears as I kiss her goodbye. My father grips my shoulder. "Remember, you're fighting for our rights, for our future," he says. I head to the Concord town green where militiamen are gathering. We're farmers, blacksmiths, shopkeepers—ordinary men about to make history.`

          title: "Lexington Green",
          content: `At dawn in Lexington, Captain John Parker lined up about 70 militiamen on the town green. They could hear the British approaching—marching feet, rattling equipment, officers shouting commands. The British force was ten times their size.

Parker told his men: "Stand your ground. Don't fire unless fired upon. But if they mean to have a war, let it begin here." These words echo in my mind as I hear the story later. What courage to stand against the British army!

The British commander, Major Pitcairn, ordered the militiamen to disperse. Parker's men began to withdraw—they couldn't fight such overwhelming numbers. Then a shot rang out. Nobody knows who fired it—British or colonist. It didn't matter. More shots followed. British soldiers fired volleys into the militia.

Eight colonists died on Lexington Green. Ten were wounded. Only one British soldier was slightly injured. It wasn't a battle—it was a slaughter. The British marched on to Concord, thinking they'd crushed colonial resistance. They were wrong.`

        {
          title: "The Battle of Concord",
          content: `By the time the British reached Concord, we'd assembled hundreds of militiamen. We watched from a ridge as British soldiers searched the town for weapons and supplies. We'd hidden most of it, but they found some and started burning it. Smoke rose from the town center.

We couldn't just watch our town burn. We marched toward the North Bridge. British soldiers guarded it. Major John Buttrick gave the order: "Fire, fellow soldiers, for God's sake, fire!" We fired. The British fired back. Two militiamen fell dead, but several British soldiers also went down. The British retreated.

This was different from Lexington. We stood our ground. We fought back. We won. The British realized they were in trouble—surrounded by armed colonists who knew every hill, every stone wall, every hiding place in this countryside.

The British began their retreat to Boston. That's when the real fighting began. We didn't fight like European armies in neat lines. We fired from behind trees, stone walls, buildings. All the way back to Boston, we harassed them. They called it cowardly. We called it smart. By day's end, 73 British soldiers were dead, 200 wounded or missing. We lost 49 killed, 39 wounded. The war had begun.`

        {
          title: "No Turning Back",
          content: `Tonight, I'm home, exhausted and shaken. I fired my musket at British soldiers today. British soldiers fired at me. Some of my neighbors are dead. This morning we were British subjects arguing about taxes and rights. Tonight we're rebels fighting for our freedom.

News of Lexington and Concord is spreading throughout the colonies. Militias are forming everywhere. Men are marching toward Boston, surrounding the British forces there. The Second Continental Congress will meet to decide what to do. But in truth, the decision has already been made—not in Philadelphia, but here in Massachusetts.

We don't yet call it a revolution. We say we're defending our rights as Englishmen. But we're not fools. We've fired on the King's troops. They've fired on us. There's no peaceful resolution now. We're at war.

Ralph Waldo Emerson would later call that first shot at Concord "the shot heard round the world." He's right. What happened here will echo far beyond Massachusetts. We've shown that ordinary people can stand up to the most powerful empire on Earth. Others will follow our example. The American Revolution has begun, and the world will never be the same.`

          title: "The Weight of Choice",
          content: `Three days have passed. The reality of what we've done settles over me like a heavy cloak. I attended the funeral of Isaac Davis, our militia captain, killed at North Bridge. His widow wept. His children—four of them, the youngest just a baby—will grow up without a father. War isn't glorious musket fire and brave speeches. It's widows and orphans and empty chairs at dinner tables.

Some neighbors have already fled, loyal to the Crown, unwilling to take up arms against their king. The Hutchinson family left yesterday for Boston and British protection. We grew up together, but now we're on opposite sides of an unbridgeable divide. How did we reach this point where neighbors become enemies?

Father asks me the hardest question: what are we really fighting for? Is it about taxes on tea? The principle of representation? Or something deeper—the right to govern ourselves, to determine our own future? I think it's all of these things and more. We're fighting because we've become Americans without fully realizing it, and Americans cannot be ruled from across an ocean by a government that doesn't listen to them.

But I worry about what we're creating. Will we simply replace British tyranny with our own? Our talk of liberty rings hollow when we keep human beings in slavery. We speak of equality while denying rights to women and the poor. If we win this war—and it's a tremendous "if" against the world's greatest military—will we live up to the principles we claim, or will we create a new version of the same old injustices?

Tonight, I clean my musket and prepare for whatever comes next. The shot heard round the world has been fired, but the story is far from finished. We've started something momentous—a revolution that might change not just our colonies, but human history itself. Or we might fail, be hanged as traitors, and be remembered as foolish rebels who overreached. Everything is uncertain except this: we've crossed the bridge, burned it behind us, and there's no going back. We're all revolutionaries now, for better or worse, and we'll live or die by the choice we made on Lexington Green and Concord Bridge.`
