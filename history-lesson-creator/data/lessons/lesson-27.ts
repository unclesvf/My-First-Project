          title: "Our Cherokee Life",
          content: `I'm Sarah, fourteen years old, Cherokee. My people have lived in these Georgia mountains for generations—longer than anyone can remember. We're not the "savages" white people imagine. We have farms, schools, a written language created by Sequoyah, our own newspaper. Many Cherokee are Christians. We live in houses, wear European-style clothing, govern ourselves with a constitution modeled on America's.

My father farms cotton and corn. My mother weaves. I attend mission school where I'm learning English alongside Cherokee. We thought if we adopted "civilization," Americans would let us stay. We believed that education, Christianity, and farming would prove we deserved our land.

But Georgia wants our land, especially since gold was discovered here. White settlers squat on Cherokee property. Georgia extends its laws over us, ignoring that we're a sovereign nation with treaties guaranteeing our territory. President Jackson won't defend our rights, even though we helped him fight the Creek in 1814.

Father says Jackson despises Indians. He sees us as obstacles to white expansion, no matter how "civilized" we become. Our adoption of European ways means nothing to him. He wants our land for white settlers, and he'll use any means to get it.`

        {
          title: "The Indian Removal Act",
          content: `In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. President Jackson claims it's voluntary—tribes can choose to move west of the Mississippi to "Indian Territory" in exchange for their eastern lands. But everyone knows the truth: refuse, and you'll be forced out anyway.

Jackson argues removal benefits us. "Your Great Father," he calls himself patronizingly, says we'll be happier away from corrupting white influence. He promises land in the West will be ours forever, that we'll govern ourselves in peace. These are lies, and we know it.

Our leaders fight back through legal channels. Chief John Ross takes our case to the Supreme Court. In Worcester v. Georgia, the Court rules that we're a sovereign nation—Georgia has no authority over us. Chief Justice Marshall writes that our treaties are valid, our rights clear.

I remember Father's joy when news came: "The Supreme Court sided with us! American law recognizes our sovereignty!" But then Jackson supposedly said, "Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it." The President refuses to enforce the Court's ruling. Law means nothing when power opposes it. We've learned a terrible lesson: justice without enforcement is just words.`

          title: "Soldiers Come",
          content: `Spring 1838. Soldiers arrive with guns and bayonets. General Winfield Scott commands 7,000 troops to round up Cherokee and force us west. They give us no time to gather belongings, to harvest crops, to bury our dead properly. We're herded like animals into stockades—temporary prison camps where we'll wait for the march west.

I watched soldiers drag families from homes. Old people, sick people, children—no one spared. Some whites who'd been waiting vultures descended on our property before we were even gone, claiming our houses, our fields, our livestock. Years of work, generations of home—stolen in moments.

In the stockades, conditions are terrible. Families crowded together, inadequate food and water, disease spreading. We wait through summer's heat in these camps. Some die before the journey even begins. The guards treat us like we're not human, like we're cargo to be shipped west.

Father tries to stay strong for us, but I see his despair. "We built everything Americans said to build," he says quietly. "We learned what they said to learn. We governed as they said to govern. And still they take everything." Mother holds us and prays, but I wonder if God hears Cherokee prayers.`

          title: "The Trail Where We Cried",
          content: `October 1838. We begin the thousand-mile march to Oklahoma. Over 16,000 Cherokee forced west in groups. It's cold already, and we're not prepared. Many have no shoes, no warm clothing. Food rations are inadequate. Water often contaminated. Dysentery, measles, whooping cough spread through our column.

We walk twenty miles a day when we can walk at all. The old and sick ride in wagons, but there aren't enough. People die every day. We bury them in shallow graves by the trail, marking them with stones if we have time. Sometimes we don't even have time for burial.

Grandmother died in November. Just got too tired, too cold, too sick. We buried her somewhere in Tennessee—I don't even know exactly where. Then my baby sister died of whooping cough. She was three years old. Mother wrapped her body and we buried her by the trail. We never even finished grieving for grandmother.

The whites we pass sometimes throw stones, shout insults. Others look away, ashamed. Some show pity but don't help. We're a people being destroyed, and America watches it happen. This isn't relocation—it's genocide disguised as policy. We call it "The Trail Where They Cried." In Cherokee: Nunna daul Tsuny.`

          title: "Oklahoma and After",
          content: `We reached Indian Territory in March 1839. Of 16,000 who started, only about 12,000 arrived. Over 4,000 dead—a quarter of our people. And we're not the only ones—Creek, Seminole, Chickasaw, Choctaw all suffered similar removals. Tens of thousands of Native peoples died in what Americans blandly call "Indian Removal."

The land here is different from our Georgia mountains. We must start over with nothing—no homes, no tools, barely any food. We're supposed to be grateful for this "new start." We're told this land is ours "as long as grass grows and water runs." But we learned that American promises mean nothing when they want something we have.

Father survived the journey but is broken. "We tried everything," he says. "We adopted their ways, their language, their religion, their government. We appealed to their laws, their courts, their God. None of it mattered. They wanted our land, so they took it. That's the only truth."

I think about what we lost. Not just land and homes, but graves of ancestors, sacred sites, the mountains that held our history. We lost a quarter of our people. We lost our faith that justice and civilization mean anything in America. We learned that America's fine words about rights and law apply only to whites.

Future Americans will debate whether removal was justified, whether it was necessary for America's growth, whether it was really that bad. But I was there. I watched my grandmother and baby sister die on that trail. I saw four thousand of my people perish because white settlers wanted gold and cotton land. I know the truth: this was evil. America knew it was evil. And they did it anyway.

The United States calls itself a beacon of liberty, a nation founded on equality and rights. But liberty doesn't extend to us. Rights don't protect us. We've learned that American ideals are selective—they apply when convenient, disappear when inconvenient. The Trail of Tears taught us that in America, power matters more than justice, and white land hunger matters more than Cherokee lives.`
