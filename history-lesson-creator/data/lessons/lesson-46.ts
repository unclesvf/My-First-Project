          title: "The Eight-Hour Day Movement",
          content: `I'm Michael, seventeen years old, and I work in a factory in Chicago making agricultural equipment. I work fourteen hours a day, six days a week. I start at 6 a.m. and finish at 8 p.m. By the time I get home, eat dinner, and sleep, there's no time for anything else. No education. No family life. No rest. Just work, sleep, work, sleep.

This is normal for American workers in the 1880s. Factory workers, miners, railroad workers—we all work twelve to fourteen hours daily. Many work seven days a week. Children as young as ten work the same hours.

But workers are organizing to change this. The eight-hour day movement demands a basic reform: limit the workday to eight hours. "Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will" is our slogan.

It seems reasonable, even modest. But employers resist fiercely. They say shorter hours would reduce production and profits. They say workers would waste free time drinking. They say competition requires long hours.

Labor unions are growing. The Knights of Labor, founded in 1869, organizes workers across industries. By 1886, it has 700,000 members. The movement is building momentum for the eight-hour day.

May 1, 1886—May Day—hundreds of thousands of workers across America strike for the eight-hour day. In Chicago, 80,000 workers walk off jobs. Factories shut down. The city grinds to a halt.

I join the strike. We march through Chicago's streets, carrying signs demanding the eight-hour day. Employers call us radicals and socialists. Police watch us carefully, hands on clubs.

The strike is mostly peaceful. But tensions are rising. Some employers hire strikebreakers. Fights break out. Police attack picket lines. The atmosphere is tense, potentially violent.`

          title: "The Haymarket Tragedy",
          content: `May 3, 1886. At the McCormick Reaper Works, police attack striking workers, killing two. Labor activists call for a protest rally the next evening at Haymarket Square.

May 4. About 3,000 people gather at Haymarket Square. Speakers denounce police violence and demand workers' rights. Chicago's mayor attends and later says the rally was peaceful. He leaves around 10 p.m. when the crowd thins.

Around 10:30, police suddenly march on the remaining crowd—about 300 people—and order them to disperse. The rally is peaceful and legal, but police want it ended.

Then it happens. Someone throws a bomb into the police ranks. The explosion kills one officer instantly and wounds many others. Police open fire into the crowd. Workers fire back—some are armed. The shooting lasts minutes but feels like hours.

When the smoke clears, seven police officers are dead or dying (most from friendly fire, investigators later conclude). At least four civilians are dead, dozens wounded. No one knows who threw the bomb. The bomber was never identified.

But Chicago's authorities blame anarchists—radical activists who advocate abolishing government. They arrest eight labor leaders, though there's no evidence linking them to the bombing. The trial is a sham—the prosecution produces no evidence of who threw the bomb, only inflammatory speeches by the defendants advocating workers' rights.

All eight are convicted. Seven are sentenced to death. One commits suicide in jail. Four are hanged. Three have their sentences commuted to life in prison. Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld later pardons the survivors, calling the trial unjust.

The Haymarket Affair devastates the labor movement. Employers paint all unions as dangerous anarchists. The Knights of Labor collapses. The eight-hour day movement stalls. Workers are afraid to organize, fearing they'll be called anarchists and arrested.`

          title: "The AFL and Craft Unionism",
          content: `After Haymarket, labor organizers change tactics. Samuel Gompers, a cigar maker, builds the American Federation of Labor (AFL) founded in 1886. The AFL takes a different approach from the Knights of Labor.

The AFL organizes only skilled workers—craftsmen like carpenters, machinists, printers. It excludes unskilled workers, women, and minorities. Gompers says skilled workers have bargaining power because they're harder to replace. Unskilled workers can be replaced easily, making them harder to organize.

The AFL focuses on "bread and butter" issues: wages, hours, and working conditions. It avoids radical politics. It doesn't call for overthrowing capitalism or fundamental economic change. It just wants better pay and shorter hours for its members.

The AFL uses collective bargaining—negotiating with employers as a group rather than individually. If employers refuse to negotiate, the AFL calls strikes. But AFL strikes are disciplined and organized, not spontaneous or violent.

This moderate approach succeeds better than radical tactics. By 1900, the AFL has one million members. It wins wage increases and hour reductions for skilled workers. Some AFL unions achieve the eight-hour day.

But the AFL's success is limited. It organizes only about 10% of the workforce—the skilled elite. The vast majority of workers—unskilled laborers, women, immigrants, Black workers—remain unorganized and exploited.

I'm not a skilled craftsman, so the AFL won't accept me. I'm still working fourteen-hour days for low wages with no union protection. The AFL's success for some workers doesn't help workers like me.

The fundamental problem remains: workers have no power individually. Employers can fire us, cut wages, worsen conditions. Only collective organization gives workers power. But organizing is dangerous—employers fire union members, blacklist them, use violence against strikes.`

          title: "The Triangle Shirtwaist Fire",
          content: `March 25, 1911. A fire breaks out at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City. The factory occupies the top three floors of a ten-story building. About 500 workers—mostly young immigrant women—work there making women's blouses.

The fire starts in a scrap bin and spreads rapidly through the fabric-filled workspace. Workers rush to escape. But the factory owners have locked the exit doors—they claim it prevents theft and unauthorized breaks.

Women pound on locked doors, screaming. Some break windows and jump from the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors. Firefighters' ladders only reach the sixth floor. Safety nets break under the weight of falling bodies.

The fire lasts less than 30 minutes. When it's over, 146 workers are dead—123 women and 23 men. Some burned to death. Others died from smoke inhalation. Many jumped to their deaths rather than burn.

I read about it in the newspapers. The stories are horrifying. Girls as young as fourteen burned alive because doors were locked. Bodies piled in stairwells. Women jumping from windows, clothes on fire.

The public is outraged. Newspapers publish photos of bodies on the sidewalk, of coffins lined up for identification. People realize that factory workers face deadly conditions daily—locked doors, no fire escapes, flammable materials everywhere, no safety regulations.

The factory owners are tried for manslaughter but acquitted—they claim they didn't know the doors were locked. But a civil suit later finds them liable, and they pay $75 per victim to families—a pittance for a life.

The Triangle Fire becomes a turning point. Public outrage forces politicians to act. New York passes fire safety laws, factory inspection laws, limits on working hours for women and children. Other states follow. The tragedy proves that workers need government protection, not just union organization.

But change comes slowly, purchased with workers' lives.`

          title: "Labor's Long Struggle",
          content: `By 1914, I'm forty-five years old. I've been a factory worker my entire adult life. The labor movement has made progress, but it's been slow and costly.

Some workers have won the eight-hour day—mostly skilled workers in AFL unions. Some states have passed safety laws, child labor restrictions, workers' compensation. The Triangle Fire led to real reforms in New York.

But most workers still labor long hours in dangerous conditions for low pay. Employers still fire union organizers. Courts still issue injunctions breaking strikes. Police still attack picket lines. Corporate power still dominates politics.

I think about the Haymarket martyrs—hanged for advocating workers' rights. I think about the Triangle Fire victims—burned alive because owners locked doors. I think about the thousands of workers killed in mines, factories, railroads, construction every year.

Labor's victories come through struggle and sacrifice. Every reform—shorter hours, safety regulations, minimum wages, child labor laws—is opposed fiercely by employers and won only through strikes, protests, and political organizing.

The fundamental conflict remains: labor versus capital. Workers create wealth through our labor. But owners control that wealth and decide how it's distributed. Owners profit enormously. Workers barely survive.

Some radicals—socialists, anarchists, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)—argue the system is fundamentally unjust. They call for workers to own the means of production, to abolish wage labor itself. They organize unskilled workers, immigrants, women—everyone the AFL excludes.

Others—reformers, Progressives, moderate unions—argue the system can be fixed with regulations, unions, and gradual reforms. They don't want revolution, just fair treatment within capitalism.

I'm not sure who's right. But I know workers deserve better than we're getting. We deserve fair wages, safe conditions, reasonable hours, respect, and dignity. Whether we achieve that through moderate reforms or radical change, the struggle continues.

Looking at my son—he's fourteen and starting factory work like I did—I hope his generation will have better. I hope the labor movement will win real power. I hope workers will finally get what we've fought for: a fair share of the wealth we create, control over our own lives, and the respect we've earned through our labor.

That's what the labor movement is about—not just wages and hours, but human dignity and economic justice. The fight is far from over.`
